## 2. Detailed Analysis by Cognitive Process

### 2.1 Working Memory

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Librarian directly addresses working memory constraints through its context assembly system:

```typescript
// From src/api/context_levels.ts
export const CONTEXT_LEVELS: Record<ContextLevel, ContextLevelDefinition> = {
  L0: { level: 'L0', maxTokens: 2000, packLimit: 4, description: 'Minimal context' },
  L1: { level: 'L1', maxTokens: 10000, packLimit: 8, description: 'Standard context' },
  L2: { level: 'L2', maxTokens: 30000, packLimit: 12, description: 'Extended context' },
  L3: { level: 'L3', maxTokens: 80000, packLimit: 20, description: 'Comprehensive context' },
};
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Token budgeting** (`token_budget.ts`): Enforces context window limits with graceful degradation
- **Context packs**: Pre-chunked knowledge units that fit cognitive slots
- **Hierarchical memory** (`hierarchical_memory.ts`): L1/L2/L3 tiered caching mirrors working memory capacity
- **Progressive disclosure**: Depth levels (L0-L3) allow zooming from minimal to comprehensive

**Features That Hinder:**
- No preview of what gets truncated when budget is exceeded
- Truncation is opaque - engineers don't see what was cut

**Gaps:**
1. No visual chunking preview showing context pack boundaries
2. No "working set" concept for tracking currently-held knowledge
3. Missing spaced repetition for frequently-accessed knowledge

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Chunk Preview**: Show context pack boundaries visually before assembly
2. **Truncation Transparency**: Display what was removed during token budget enforcement
3. **Working Set Indicator**: Show what knowledge is currently "loaded"

---

### 2.2 Long-term Memory

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Librarian has a sophisticated persistent knowledge system:

```typescript
// From src/knowledge/index.ts - Knowledge categories
export type KnowledgeCategory =
  | 'architecture'   // Structural memory
  | 'impact'         // Causal relationships
  | 'quality'        // Quality metrics history
  | 'patterns'       // Recurring structures
  | 'structure'      // Organization memory
  | 'evolution';     // Change history
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Evidence system** (`evidence_system.ts`): Tracks claims with provenance
- **Universal Knowledge schema**: Comprehensive entity representation with history
- **Confidence decay**: Time-based confidence reduction mimics forgetting curves
- **Outcome tracking**: Success/failure history reinforces accurate knowledge

**Features That Hinder:**
- Forgetting is passive (time-decay only), not active (no spaced repetition)
- No explicit retrieval cue system

**Gaps:**
1. No spaced repetition for important knowledge
2. Missing explicit retrieval cues for navigating large codebases
3. No personalized knowledge paths based on individual access patterns

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Retrieval Cues**: Surface related knowledge when querying
2. **Knowledge Aging Display**: Show how "fresh" knowledge is
3. **Personal Access Patterns**: Track and surface frequently-accessed entities

---

### 2.3 Attention

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Relevance filtering and confidence-based prioritization:

```typescript
// From src/api/context_assembly.ts
const LOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = configurable(
  0.4,
  [0, 1],
  'Flag files as low-confidence when coverage drops below this threshold.'
);
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Multi-signal scoring** (`multi_signal_scorer.ts`): Combines signals for relevance
- **Confidence thresholds**: Filter out low-confidence noise
- **Priority ordering**: Sort by relevance/confidence
- **Coverage gaps surfacing**: Highlight what needs attention

**Features That Hinder:**
- No explicit focus mode to suppress distractions
- All knowledge is treated equally regardless of current task

**Gaps:**
1. No task-focused filtering (suppress irrelevant modules during specific work)
2. Missing "attention budget" concept
3. No distraction warnings when context switches

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Focus Mode**: Allow engineers to declare current focus area
2. **Attention Warnings**: Alert when retrieved context is tangential
3. **Context Switch Detection**: Notice and highlight when queries shift domains

---

### 2.4 Pattern Recognition

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Comprehensive pattern detection system:

```typescript
// From src/knowledge/patterns.ts
export interface PatternQuery {
  type:
    | 'design_patterns'   // Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.
    | 'anti_patterns'     // God objects, circular deps
    | 'naming'            // Naming conventions
    | 'team_style'        // Team coding patterns
    | 'recurring'         // Repeated structures
    | 'emergent'          // Discovered patterns
    | 'error_handling'    // Error handling patterns
    | 'async_patterns'    // Async/await patterns
    | 'testing_patterns'; // Testing patterns
}
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Design pattern detection**: Identifies Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Builder
- **Anti-pattern alerting**: God Object, Long Method, Feature Envy, Circular Dependencies
- **LLM-backed verification**: Semantic pattern claims verified by LLM synthesis
- **Graph-based emergence**: PageRank/betweenness detect community structure

**Features That Hinder:**
- Heuristic detection deprecated but still available (confusing)
- LLM dependency for semantic patterns means degraded mode is less useful

**Gaps:**
1. No pattern templates for common tasks (no "this looks like a CRUD operation")
2. Missing pattern learning from engineer confirmations
3. No cross-project pattern library

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Pattern Suggestions**: "This looks like [pattern], confirm?"
2. **Pattern Learning**: Reinforce patterns based on engineer feedback
3. **Anti-pattern Explanations**: Show why something is an anti-pattern with examples

---

### 2.5 Problem Decomposition

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Limited explicit support - mostly through structure knowledge:

```typescript
// From src/knowledge/structure.ts
export interface StructureQuery {
  type:
    | 'file_types'       // What kinds of files
    | 'organization'     // How organized
    | ...
}
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Module boundaries**: Shows natural decomposition points
- **Dependency graphs**: Reveals how components relate
- **Layer detection**: Identifies architectural layers

**Features That Hinder:**
- No explicit "break this down" functionality
- Structure is descriptive, not prescriptive for decomposition

**Gaps:**
1. No task decomposition scaffolds ("to implement X, you need Y, Z, W")
2. Missing work breakdown structure generation
3. No dependency-aware task ordering

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Decomposition Wizard**: "Decompose [task] into subtasks"
2. **Prerequisite Detection**: Show what must be done first
3. **Scope Estimation**: Estimate complexity of decomposed tasks

---

### 2.6 Analogical Transfer

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Limited to similar task retrieval:

```typescript
// From src/api/context_assembly.ts
supplementary: {
  similarTasks: SimilarTaskMatch[];
  ...
}
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Similar tasks retrieval**: Finds past similar work
- **Pattern matching**: Identifies when current situation matches known patterns
- **Evolution knowledge**: Historical approaches to similar problems

**Features That Hinder:**
- Similar tasks are just retrieved, not analyzed for transferable lessons
- No explicit mapping of how past solution applies to current problem

**Gaps:**
1. No explicit analogy construction ("X is to Y as A is to B")
2. Missing "lessons learned" extraction from similar tasks
3. No structural analogy mapping

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Analogy Assistant**: "Similar problem in [module] was solved by [approach]"
2. **Transfer Mapping**: Show how past solution maps to current problem
3. **Adaptation Hints**: Highlight what needs to change from similar solution

---

### 2.7 Mental Models

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Visualization capabilities:

```typescript
// From src/visualization/ascii_diagrams.ts
export function generateASCIITree(knowledge: UniversalKnowledge[], focusPath?: string): ASCIIResult
export function generateDependencyBox(knowledge: UniversalKnowledge, allKnowledge: UniversalKnowledge[]): ASCIIResult
export function generateHealthSummary(knowledge: UniversalKnowledge[]): ASCIIResult
```

**Features That Help:**
- **ASCII tree diagrams**: Structural visualization
- **Dependency box diagrams**: Show relationships
- **Mermaid diagram generation**: Rich visualizations
- **Health summaries**: Quick codebase overview
- **Graph metrics**: PageRank, betweenness, communities

**Features That Hinder:**
- Visualizations are static, not interactive
- No zoom/explore capability in diagrams
- Missing animation for understanding flow

**Gaps:**
1. No interactive exploration of mental models
2. Missing progressive reveal of complexity
3. No personalized model building over time

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Interactive Diagrams**: Click to explore, zoom, filter
2. **Model Layers**: Show/hide complexity layers
3. **Personal Model History**: Track how understanding evolves

---

### 2.8 Decision Making

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Minimal direct support - recommendations only:

```typescript
// From src/recommendations/architecture_advisor.ts
export interface ArchitectureRecommendation {
  type: ArchitectureIssueType;
  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  affected: EntityReference[];
  suggestion: string;
  diagram?: string;
}
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Recommendations**: Suggests actions for detected issues
- **Severity levels**: Prioritizes what to address
- **Refactoring candidates**: Identifies improvement opportunities

**Features That Hinder:**
- No trade-off analysis between options
- Missing consequence prediction
- No decision history tracking

**Gaps:**
1. No explicit decision support ("Option A vs Option B")
2. Missing consequence prediction ("if you do X, likely Y")
3. No decision journal for tracking past choices and outcomes

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Trade-off Analyzer**: Compare approaches with pros/cons
2. **Consequence Prediction**: "This change will affect N modules"
3. **Decision Log**: Track decisions and their outcomes over time

---

### 2.9 Metacognition

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Partial support through coverage and confidence:

```typescript
// From src/api/context_assembly.ts
coverage: {
  percentage: number;
  gaps: KnowledgeGap[];
  lowConfidence: LowConfidenceItem[];
}
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Coverage gaps**: Explicitly surfaces what's missing
- **Low confidence flagging**: Highlights uncertain knowledge
- **Disclosure system**: Transparently marks limitations
- **Adequacy reports**: Assesses if knowledge is sufficient

**Features That Hinder:**
- Gaps are listed but not explained
- No "why don't I know this" explanation

**Gaps:**
1. No explicit "what I don't know" surfacing for engineers
2. Missing uncertainty quantification explanation
3. No metacognitive prompts ("are you sure this is right?")

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Knowledge Boundaries**: Explicitly show what Librarian doesn't know
2. **Uncertainty Explanation**: Why is confidence low?
3. **Self-Assessment Prompts**: "This area has low coverage, consider verifying"

---

### 2.10 Cognitive Load

**How Librarian Supports This:**

Implicit through progressive depth:

```typescript
// From src/api/governor_context.ts
recommendStrategy(): BudgetCheckResult {
  // Strategies: proceed, use_cache, use_cheaper_model, batch_aggressive, prioritize, defer
}
```

**Features That Help:**
- **Progressive depth levels** (L0-L3): Control information volume
- **Budget management**: Limits overwhelming context
- **Truncation with steps**: Shows what was removed

**Features That Hinder:**
- No complexity warnings before retrieval
- Missing cognitive load estimation
- No "too much information" alerts

**Gaps:**
1. No cognitive load estimation for retrieved context
2. Missing complexity pre-warnings
3. No adaptive simplification based on detected overload

**UX Improvements Needed:**
1. **Complexity Meter**: Show estimated cognitive load of context
2. **Overload Warning**: Alert when context exceeds typical processing capacity
3. **Adaptive Simplification**: Automatically simplify when load is high

## 4. Priority Fixes

### Priority 1: Problem Decomposition Support

**Rationale**: Engineers constantly decompose problems; Librarian provides zero scaffolding.

**Implementation**:
1. Add `DecompositionQuery` type to LibrarianQuery
2. Create `decompose()` method that:
   - Analyzes target task/feature description
   - Identifies affected modules via impact analysis
   - Orders subtasks by dependency graph
   - Estimates effort per subtask
3. Surface as interactive checklist with dependencies shown

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/types.ts`: Add decomposition types
- `src/knowledge/index.ts`: Add decomposition query handler
- New file: `src/agents/decomposition_agent.ts`

### Priority 2: Cognitive Load Management

**Rationale**: No warning when context is overwhelming; engineers struggle silently.

**Implementation**:
1. Add cognitive load estimation heuristic:
   - Count distinct concepts (modules, functions, types)
   - Measure relationship density
   - Calculate reading time estimate
2. Add warning thresholds to context assembly
3. Surface load indicator in response

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/api/context_assembly.ts`: Add load calculation
- `src/api/context_levels.ts`: Add load thresholds
- `src/types.ts`: Add CognitiveLoadEstimate to LibrarianResponse

### Priority 3: Decision Support Framework

**Rationale**: Recommendations exist but no way to compare alternatives.

**Implementation**:
1. Add `DecisionQuery` type with options list
2. Create comparison matrix generator:
   - Pros/cons for each option
   - Impact analysis per option
   - Risk assessment per option
3. Track decision outcomes over time

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/types.ts`: Add decision types
- New file: `src/knowledge/decisions.ts`
- `src/storage/types.ts`: Add decision history storage

### Priority 4: Interactive Mental Models

**Rationale**: Current diagrams are static; engineers can't explore.

**Implementation**:
1. Add drill-down markers to ASCII/Mermaid diagrams
2. Create query interface for diagram exploration
3. Support filtering/hiding complexity layers

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/visualization/ascii_diagrams.ts`: Add interactive markers
- `src/visualization/mermaid_generator.ts`: Add layer controls
- `src/api/query_interface.ts`: Add diagram navigation queries

---

## 5. Conclusion

Librarian demonstrates sophisticated support for memory-related cognitive processes (Working Memory, Long-term Memory) and pattern recognition. However, it lacks explicit support for higher-order cognitive processes that engineers rely on daily:

1. **Problem Decomposition**: Engineers must decompose complex tasks manually
2. **Decision Making**: No trade-off analysis or consequence prediction
3. **Cognitive Load**: No awareness of information overload

The proposed priority fixes address these gaps by adding:
- Decomposition scaffolds that leverage existing dependency analysis
- Cognitive load estimation built on existing context assembly
- Decision comparison tools using existing impact analysis
- Interactive exploration of existing visualizations

These additions would transform Librarian from a sophisticated knowledge retrieval system into a true cognitive partner that augments all major engineering thought processes.
