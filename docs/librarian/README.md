## What Librarian Is
Librarian is the knowledge and understanding layer for any codebase. It
extracts, constructs, and serves evidence-backed understanding for agents
and humans, with calibrated confidence, defeaters, and explicit traces.

## What Librarian Provides
- Understanding: purpose, mechanism, contract, dependencies, consequences.
- Knowledge mappings: dependency, data flow, ownership, risk, tests, rationale.
- Agent-ready responses: answer + evidence + confidence + next actions.
- Method guidance: hints and checklists for applicable problem-solving methods.
- Full lifecycle support: onboarding, change, debug, refactor, release.
- Universal codebase support: immediate onboarding for new languages.

## What Librarian Is Not
- Not a general-purpose orchestrator or task runner.
- Not a replacement for tests, reviews, or CI.
- Not a fake-embedding system or heuristic-only retrieval.

## Start Here (Decision Tree)
- **Orchestration & Validation Roadmap** -> `/CODEX_ORCHESTRATOR.md` (Phases 0-22)
- Doc architecture + governance -> `docs/librarian/DOCS_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Non-negotiable mission -> `docs/librarian/VISION.md`
- System architecture + directory map -> `docs/librarian/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Knowledge ontology + mappings -> `docs/librarian/UNDERSTANDING_LAYER.md`
- Use-case coverage -> `docs/librarian/scenarios.md`
- Use-case matrix (250+ needs + method catalog + coverage audit) -> `docs/librarian/USE_CASE_MATRIX.md`
- Wiring and pipelines -> `docs/librarian/PIPELINES_AND_WIRING.md`
- Implementation plan -> `docs/librarian/WORKPLAN.md`
- Integration plan -> `docs/librarian/IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
- Packaging and onboarding -> `docs/librarian/PACKAGING_AND_ONBOARDING.md`
- Model selection policy -> `docs/librarian/MODEL_POLICY.md`
- Validation and audits -> `docs/librarian/validation.md`, `docs/librarian/AUDIT.md`
- Target vs reality -> `docs/librarian/STATUS.md`
- Phase 6+ (super-brain roadmap; planned) -> `docs/librarian/SUPER_BRAIN_PLAN.md`
- Super-brain implementation protocol -> `docs/librarian/SUPER_BRAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md`

## Canonical Doc Map
- `/CODEX_ORCHESTRATOR.md` (full implementation + validation roadmap, Phases 0-22)
- `docs/librarian/DOCS_ARCHITECTURE.md` (doc governance)
- `docs/librarian/VISION.md` (why we exist)
- `docs/librarian/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` (components, boundaries, directory map)
- `docs/librarian/UNDERSTANDING_LAYER.md` (knowledge primitives + constructions)
- `docs/librarian/scenarios.md` (use-case taxonomy + prompts)
- `docs/librarian/USE_CASE_MATRIX.md` (use-case matrix + dependencies + method catalog)
- `docs/librarian/PIPELINES_AND_WIRING.md` (end-to-end system wiring)
- `docs/librarian/WORKPLAN.md` (phased build plan)
- `docs/librarian/IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` (Wave0 + external integration plan)
- `docs/librarian/PACKAGING_AND_ONBOARDING.md` (packaging + onboarding)
- `docs/librarian/MODEL_POLICY.md` (daily model selection)
- `docs/librarian/validation.md` (test and evidence gates, RAGAS-style metrics)
- `docs/librarian/AUDIT.md` (audit runbook)
- `docs/librarian/STATUS.md` (target vs reality, evidence linked)
- `docs/librarian/GATES.json` (machine-readable gate status, layers 0-7)
- `docs/librarian/SUPER_BRAIN_PLAN.md` (Phase 6+: super-brain roadmap; planned)
- `docs/librarian/MASTER.md` (working synthesis notes; not canonical)

## How to Interpret Docs
- `STATUS.md` is reality with evidence; treat it as truth.
- `WORKPLAN.md` is forward-looking; treat it as intent until verified.
- `legacy/` is research-only; do not treat it as current guidance.

## System Success Criteria
- Every answer includes evidence, confidence, and defeaters.
- Every scenario in `docs/librarian/scenarios.md` is answerable end-to-end.
- Every row in `docs/librarian/USE_CASE_MATRIX.md` maps to architecture or plans.
- No provider bypass, no fake embeddings, no unverified claims.
- Librarian is the single source of understanding for Wave0.
- Any language is supported on first encounter with explicit evidence.

## Operational Rules (Hard)
- CLI auth only (no API keys).
- Providers checked via `checkAllProviders()`.
- Daily model selection is mandatory and recorded in `state/audits/model_selection/`.
- Cheapest SOTA models are required (Haiku-class for Librarian unless proven insufficient).
- If providers are unavailable, fail with `unverified_by_trace(provider_unavailable)`.
- New language detection must trigger immediate adapter onboarding (no hard fail).
- Default to waiting for long-running steps unless explicitly directed otherwise.

## Legacy Research
Historical docs are archived in `docs/librarian/legacy/` and must be
explicitly merged into canonical docs before being relied upon.

## Open-Source Growth
Librarian is designed to be an open-source knowledge system with explicit
extension points, contribution standards, and community-driven evolution.
