## Executive Summary

When you optimize a foundational function called 1000x/day, benefits cascade to everything that depends on it. When you break something foundational, damage cascades. This research defines **computationally tractable algorithms** for quantifying these cascading effects across Librarian's multi-graph knowledge system.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Propagation Algorithm Specification** - Three algorithm families with complexity analysis: PageRank-based diffusion, spreading activation, and random walk with restart
2. **Amplification/Dampening Model** - Edge-type-specific propagation factors based on coupling, stability, and test coverage
3. **Cross-Graph Propagation Rules** - How impact flows from code → rationale → epistemic and back
4. **API Design** - Concrete interfaces for benefit quantification and blast radius analysis
5. **Visualization Specification** - Propagation path rendering for agent consumption

**Core Insight**: Propagation is not symmetric. Benefits propagate along `calls` edges (callers benefit from callee improvements), while risks propagate against `calls` edges (callers break when callees break). This directional asymmetry is essential for accurate modeling.

## Existing Infrastructure Analysis

### Current Blast Radius (BFS with Depth Limit)

**File**: `src/knowledge/impact.ts`

```typescript
// Current implementation: Simple BFS with depth limit
private async analyzeBlastRadius(query: ImpactQuery): Promise<ImpactResult> {
  const maxDepth = query.depth ?? 3;
  const queue: Array<{ path: string; depth: number }> = [{ path: targetModule.path, depth: 0 }];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const current = queue.shift();
    if (current.depth >= maxDepth) continue;
    for (const dependent of reverse.get(current.path) ?? []) {
      // ... add to affected list
      queue.push({ path: dependent, depth: current.depth + 1 });
    }
  }
}
```

**Limitations:**
- Binary inclusion (affected or not), no weight propagation
- Uniform depth limit, doesn't consider edge importance
- No differentiation between edge types
- Single graph only (module dependencies)

### PageRank Implementation

**File**: `src/graphs/pagerank.ts`

```typescript
export function computePageRank(graph: Graph, options: PageRankOptions = {}): Map<string, number> {
  // Standard iterative PageRank with damping factor
  const dampingFactor = options.dampingFactor ?? 0.85;
  // ... power iteration until convergence
}
```

**Useful Properties:**
- Already implements damping (propagation decay)
- Handles cycles without infinite loops
- Converges in O(E * iterations) time

### Defeater Propagation

**File**: `src/epistemics/defeaters.ts`

```typescript
// Transitive defeat propagation with BFS
export async function propagateDefeat(
  storage: EvidenceGraphStorage,
  defeatedClaimId: ClaimId,
  maxDepth: number = 10
): Promise<AffectedClaim[]> {
  // BFS traversal through depends_on, assumes, supports edges
  // Edge-type-specific suggested actions
}
```

**Key Insight**: Already implements cross-graph propagation for epistemic claims with edge-type-specific behavior.

### Knowledge Aggregation

**File**: `src/understanding/knowledge_aggregation.ts`

```typescript
// Confidence propagation factor (decay per level)
propagationFactor: 0.95,  // 5% decay per aggregation level

// Defeater propagation rules
// - Critical: Always propagate
// - High: Propagate if > 50% of children affected
```

**Key Insight**: Already defines propagation factors for hierarchical aggregation.

## Influence Propagation Algorithms

### Algorithm 1: Personalized PageRank (PPR)

**Concept**: Start a random walk from a source node. At each step, with probability α, return to the source; with probability 1-α, follow a random outgoing edge.

**Formula**:
```
PPR(s, t) = α * I(s=t) + (1-α) * Σ (w(u,t) / out_degree(u)) * PPR(s, u)
           for each u with edge to t
```

**Application to Cascading Impact**:

```python
def personalized_pagerank_impact(source: Node, alpha: float = 0.15) -> Dict[Node, float]:
    """
    Compute the impact of 'source' on all other nodes.

    - alpha: restart probability (higher = more localized impact)
    - Returns: impact score for each reachable node
    """
    scores = {source: 1.0}
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        new_scores = defaultdict(float)
        for node, score in scores.items():
            # Restart contribution
            new_scores[source] += alpha * score
            # Propagation contribution
            for neighbor in outgoing(node):
                edge_weight = get_edge_weight(node, neighbor)
                new_scores[neighbor] += (1 - alpha) * score * edge_weight / out_degree(node)
        scores = new_scores
        if converged(scores, new_scores): break
    return scores
```

**Complexity**: O(E * iterations) per source node. For k source nodes: O(k * E * iterations).

**Advantages**:
- Handles cycles naturally
- Decay built-in via restart probability
- Well-studied, efficient implementations exist

**When to Use**: Computing importance of a specific node (how much does X affect the system?).

### Algorithm 2: Heat Kernel Diffusion

**Concept**: Model impact as heat diffusing through the graph. Nodes close to the heat source (impacted entity) receive more heat.

**Formula**:
```
H(t) = exp(-t * L) * h(0)

Where:
- L = D - A (Graph Laplacian: degree matrix minus adjacency matrix)
- t = diffusion time (controls spread distance)
- h(0) = initial heat vector (1.0 at source, 0 elsewhere)
```

**Application to Cascading Impact**:

```python
def heat_kernel_impact(source: Node, t: float = 1.0) -> Dict[Node, float]:
    """
    Compute heat diffusion from source.

    - t: diffusion time (higher = wider spread)
    - Uses matrix exponential approximation
    """
    # Build Laplacian
    L = degree_matrix(G) - adjacency_matrix(G)

    # Initial heat at source
    h0 = zeros(n_nodes)
    h0[source.index] = 1.0

    # Compute diffusion: H = exp(-tL) * h0
    # Use Taylor series approximation for efficiency
    H = h0.copy()
    term = h0.copy()
    for k in range(1, max_terms):
        term = (-t / k) * L @ term
        H += term
        if norm(term) < tolerance: break

    return {node: H[node.index] for node in G.nodes}
```

**Complexity**: O(n * E) per iteration of Taylor approximation, typically 10-20 iterations sufficient.

**Advantages**:
- Smooth decay with distance
- Parameter `t` controls spread radius
- Theoretically grounded in diffusion physics

**When to Use**: Understanding gradual impact spread, less sensitive to exact graph structure.

### Algorithm 3: Spreading Activation

**Concept**: Inspired by neural networks. Nodes receive activation from neighbors, apply a non-linear transformation, and spread activation further.

**Formula**:
```
a(v, t+1) = f(Σ w(u,v) * a(u, t)) * decay_factor
           for each u with edge to v

Where:
- f(x) = sigmoid or ReLU for non-linearity
- decay_factor controls propagation distance
```

**Application to Cascading Impact**:

```python
def spreading_activation_impact(
    source: Node,
    initial_activation: float = 1.0,
    decay: float = 0.8,
    threshold: float = 0.01
) -> Dict[Node, float]:
    """
    Spreading activation from source.

    - decay: activation decay per hop
    - threshold: minimum activation to continue spreading
    """
    activations = {source: initial_activation}
    frontier = {source}

    while frontier:
        next_frontier = set()
        for node in frontier:
            current_activation = activations[node]
            if current_activation < threshold:
                continue

            for neighbor, edge_weight in outgoing_weighted(node):
                propagated = current_activation * decay * edge_weight

                if neighbor in activations:
                    activations[neighbor] = max(activations[neighbor], propagated)
                else:
                    activations[neighbor] = propagated
                    next_frontier.add(neighbor)

        frontier = next_frontier

    return activations
```

**Complexity**: O(E) worst case, but threshold pruning typically makes it O(E_reachable) where E_reachable << E.

**Advantages**:
- Threshold pruning prevents exponential blowup
- Edge weights naturally incorporated
- Intuitive decay semantics

**When to Use**: Computing impact from a single source with controllable spread distance.

### Algorithm 4: Random Walk with Restart (RWR)

**Concept**: Simulate many random walks starting from source. Count how often each node is visited.

**Formula**:
```
P(v | source) = (1-α) * Σ P(u | source) * T(u,v) + α * I(v = source)
               for each u with edge to v

Where:
- T(u,v) = transition probability from u to v
- α = restart probability
```

**Application to Cascading Impact**:

```python
def random_walk_with_restart_impact(
    source: Node,
    alpha: float = 0.15,
    n_walks: int = 1000,
    max_steps: int = 100
) -> Dict[Node, float]:
    """
    Monte Carlo simulation of random walks.

    - alpha: restart probability
    - n_walks: number of walks to simulate
    - max_steps: maximum steps per walk
    """
    visit_counts = defaultdict(int)

    for _ in range(n_walks):
        current = source
        for step in range(max_steps):
            visit_counts[current] += 1

            if random() < alpha:
                current = source  # Restart
            else:
                neighbors = list(outgoing(current))
                if not neighbors:
                    current = source  # Dead end, restart
                else:
                    current = weighted_choice(neighbors)

    total_visits = sum(visit_counts.values())
    return {node: count / total_visits for node, count in visit_counts.items()}
```

**Complexity**: O(n_walks * max_steps). Easily parallelizable.

**Advantages**:
- Unbiased estimator of stationary distribution
- Handles very large graphs via sampling
- Trivially parallelizable

**When to Use**: Very large graphs where matrix methods are infeasible.

### Algorithm Recommendation

| Use Case | Recommended Algorithm | Reason |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| Blast radius (risk) | Spreading Activation | Threshold pruning, natural decay |
| Benefit quantification | Personalized PageRank | Stable importance scores |
| Gradual impact assessment | Heat Kernel | Smooth decay, less sensitive to exact structure |
| Very large graphs (>1M nodes) | Random Walk with Restart | Sampling-based, parallelizable |

**Primary Recommendation for Librarian**: **Spreading Activation** with edge-type-specific decay factors. Reasons:
1. Threshold pruning prevents exponential blowup
2. Edge weights map naturally to coupling strength
3. Can use different decay factors for benefits vs risks
4. Existing BFS infrastructure can be adapted

## Cascading Benefit vs Cascading Risk

### Directional Asymmetry

**Key Insight**: Benefits and risks propagate in OPPOSITE directions through the same graph.

```
A calls B calls C

Risk propagation (if C breaks):
  C breaks → B fails → A fails
  Direction: AGAINST the calls edge (caller depends on callee)

Benefit propagation (if C is optimized):
  C faster → B faster → A faster
  Direction: AGAINST the calls edge (caller benefits from callee improvement)

But wait - they're the same direction!
```

Actually, both propagate in the same direction (upstream), but with different semantics:

| Aspect | Risk Propagation | Benefit Propagation |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Direction | Upstream (to callers) | Upstream (to callers) |
| Magnitude | Often multiplicative | Often additive |
| Probability | High (single break cascades) | Variable (depends on usage pattern) |
| Dampening | Low (breaks cascade strongly) | Higher (benefits dilute) |

### The Usage Multiplier Effect

```typescript
// High-usage optimization scenario
function parseJSON(str: string): any {
  // Called 10,000 times/day
  // If optimized by 1ms, total benefit = 10,000 * 1ms = 10 seconds/day
}

function processRequest(req: Request) {
  // Calls parseJSON once per request
  // 1000 requests/day
  // Benefit from parseJSON optimization: 1000 * 1ms = 1 second/day
}
```

**Benefit Propagation Formula**:
```
Benefit(caller) = UsageCount(caller) * BenefitPerCall(callee) * CouplingStrength(caller, callee)
```

**Risk Propagation Formula**:
```
Risk(caller) = P(callee_breaks) * Impact(break_on_caller) * CouplingStrength(caller, callee)
```

### Risk Amplification Scenarios

| Scenario | Risk Behavior | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Single point of failure | Risk multiplies | Database connection breaks all services |
| Fallback exists | Risk dampens | Primary fails but secondary works |
| Retry logic | Risk dampens | Transient failures recovered |
| No error handling | Risk amplifies | Exception propagates to top |
| Circuit breaker | Risk truncates | Fast-fail prevents cascade |

### Benefit Amplification Scenarios

| Scenario | Benefit Behavior | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Hot path optimization | Benefit multiplies | Cache hit on frequent query |
| Cold path optimization | Benefit dampens | Rarely executed code |
| Shared library | Benefit multiplies | All consumers benefit |
| Dead code | Benefit zero | Optimizing unused code |
| Bottleneck removal | Benefit multiplies | Queue drains faster |

## Multi-Hop Effect Simulation

### The Exponential Blowup Problem

A naive approach:
```
For each node at depth d:
    For each dependent at depth d+1:
        Compute impact...
```

If average out-degree is k and depth is d, this is O(k^d).

### Solution 1: Importance Threshold Pruning

```python
def propagate_with_threshold(source: Node, threshold: float = 0.01):
    """Stop propagation when impact falls below threshold."""
    impact = {source: 1.0}
    frontier = {source}

    while frontier:
        next_frontier = set()
        for node in frontier:
            node_impact = impact[node]

            for neighbor, edge_weight in outgoing_weighted(node):
                propagated_impact = node_impact * edge_weight * DECAY_FACTOR

                # PRUNING: Don't propagate tiny impacts
                if propagated_impact < threshold:
                    continue

                if neighbor not in impact:
                    impact[neighbor] = propagated_impact
                    next_frontier.add(neighbor)
                elif propagated_impact > impact[neighbor]:
                    impact[neighbor] = propagated_impact
                    next_frontier.add(neighbor)  # Re-propagate higher impact

        frontier = next_frontier

    return impact
```

**Complexity**: O(E_significant) where E_significant is edges carrying above-threshold impact. Typically much smaller than E.

### Solution 2: Adaptive Depth Limits

```python
def adaptive_depth_propagation(source: Node, max_impact_nodes: int = 1000):
    """Dynamically adjust depth based on node count."""
    impact = {source: 1.0}
    current_depth = 0
    max_depth = 10  # Hard limit

    while current_depth < max_depth and len(impact) < max_impact_nodes:
        # Propagate one level
        new_impacts = propagate_one_level(impact, current_depth)
        impact.update(new_impacts)
        current_depth += 1

        # If we're about to explode, stop
        if len(impact) > max_impact_nodes * 0.9:
            break

    return impact, current_depth
```

### Solution 3: Top-K Propagation

```python
def top_k_propagation(source: Node, k: int = 100):
    """Only track top-k most impacted nodes."""
    impact = {source: 1.0}
    heap = [(-1.0, source)]  # Max-heap via negation

    while heap:
        neg_imp, node = heappop(heap)
        node_impact = -neg_imp

        for neighbor, edge_weight in outgoing_weighted(node):
            propagated = node_impact * edge_weight * DECAY_FACTOR

            if neighbor not in impact:
                if len(impact) < k:
                    impact[neighbor] = propagated
                    heappush(heap, (-propagated, neighbor))
                elif propagated > min(impact.values()):
                    # Replace lowest-impact node
                    min_node = min(impact, key=impact.get)
                    del impact[min_node]
                    impact[neighbor] = propagated
                    heappush(heap, (-propagated, neighbor))

    return impact
```

**Complexity**: O(E * log k) - Maintains heap of size k.

### Solution 4: Memoized Graph Metrics

**Observation**: Centrality scores can be precomputed. A node's "potential blast radius" is related to its betweenness/PageRank.

```python
# During indexing (offline)
def precompute_blast_metrics():
    return {
        'pagerank': compute_pagerank(G),
        'betweenness': compute_betweenness(G),
        'reachable_count': compute_reachable_counts(G, max_depth=5),
    }

# During query (online)
def fast_blast_radius_estimate(source: Node, metrics: Dict):
    """O(1) estimate using precomputed metrics."""
    return {
        'estimated_affected': metrics['reachable_count'][source],
        'centrality_risk': metrics['betweenness'][source],
        'importance': metrics['pagerank'][source],
    }
```

### Recommended Approach

**Hybrid Strategy**:
1. **Precompute**: PageRank, betweenness, reachable counts (updated during index)
2. **Online Query**: Spreading activation with threshold pruning
3. **Fallback**: If result set > max_impact_nodes, return precomputed estimate

```python
def cascading_impact(source: Node, direction: 'benefit' | 'risk') -> ImpactResult:
    # Fast path: use precomputed estimate
    precomputed = get_precomputed_metrics(source)
    if precomputed.estimated_affected > MAX_DETAILED_NODES:
        return quick_estimate_from_metrics(source, precomputed)

    # Detailed path: spreading activation
    config = RISK_CONFIG if direction == 'risk' else BENEFIT_CONFIG
    impact = spreading_activation(
        source=source,
        decay=config.decay,
        threshold=config.threshold,
        edge_weights=get_edge_weights(direction)
    )

    return format_impact_result(impact, source, direction)
```

## Amplification and Dampening Factors

### Edge-Type Propagation Factors

| Edge Type | Risk Factor | Benefit Factor | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| `imports` | 0.9 | 0.3 | Import break is severe; import optimization has modest benefit |
| `calls` | 0.85 | 0.6 | Call failure cascades; optimization benefits compound |
| `extends` | 0.95 | 0.4 | Breaking superclass breaks subclasses; optimization less portable |
| `implements` | 0.7 | 0.2 | Interface changes need implementation updates |
| `clone_of` | 0.3 | 0.1 | Clones are independent; changes don't propagate directly |
| `co_changed` | 0.5 | 0.3 | Historical correlation, not causal |
| `tests` | 0.8 | 0.1 | Test failure indicates problem; test optimization rarely helps |
| `documents` | 0.1 | 0.05 | Documentation changes rarely break code |
| `part_of` | 0.7 | 0.5 | Hierarchical containment |

### Coupling Strength Modifiers

```typescript
interface CouplingModifier {
  // Structural coupling
  parameterCount: number;      // More parameters = tighter coupling
  returnTypeComplexity: number; // Complex returns = tighter coupling
  sharedState: boolean;        // Shared mutable state = very tight coupling

  // Behavioral coupling
  callFrequency: number;       // Higher frequency = higher impact multiplier
  exceptionFlow: boolean;      // Does caller handle callee exceptions?

  // Calculate modifier
  calculate(): number {
    let modifier = 1.0;

    // Parameter coupling
    modifier *= Math.min(1.5, 1 + this.parameterCount * 0.1);

    // Shared state is high risk
    if (this.sharedState) modifier *= 1.5;

    // High frequency amplifies impact
    modifier *= Math.log10(Math.max(1, this.callFrequency)) / 2;

    // Unhandled exceptions cascade strongly
    if (!this.exceptionFlow) modifier *= 1.2;

    return modifier;
  }
}
```

### Interface Stability Modifiers

| Stability Level | Risk Dampening | Benefit Dampening |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `stable_public_api` | 0.5x | 0.8x |
| `versioned_api` | 0.6x | 0.7x |
| `internal_api` | 1.0x | 1.0x |
| `experimental` | 1.2x | 1.0x |
| `deprecated` | 0.7x | 0.5x |

**Rationale**: Stable APIs have contracts; changes are less likely to break callers. Deprecated APIs have fallbacks.

### Test Coverage Modifiers

```typescript
function getTestCoverageModifier(entity: Entity): number {
  const coverage = entity.coverage ?? 0;
  const hasIntegrationTests = entity.hasIntegrationTests ?? false;
  const hasMutationTesting = entity.hasMutationTesting ?? false;

  // High coverage reduces risk propagation
  let riskModifier = 1.0 - (coverage * 0.5);  // 0% coverage = 1.0, 100% = 0.5

  // Integration tests provide additional safety
  if (hasIntegrationTests) riskModifier *= 0.8;

  // Mutation testing indicates robust tests
  if (hasMutationTesting) riskModifier *= 0.9;

  // Clamp to reasonable range
  return Math.max(0.3, Math.min(1.0, riskModifier));
}
```

### Combined Propagation Factor Formula

```typescript
function calculatePropagationFactor(
  edge: Edge,
  direction: 'risk' | 'benefit',
  sourceEntity: Entity,
  targetEntity: Entity
): number {
  // Base factor from edge type
  const baseFactor = direction === 'risk'
    ? RISK_FACTORS[edge.type]
    : BENEFIT_FACTORS[edge.type];

  // Coupling strength modifier
  const coupling = getCouplingStrength(edge);
  const couplingModifier = direction === 'risk'
    ? coupling  // Risk amplified by tight coupling
    : Math.sqrt(coupling);  // Benefit less sensitive

  // Stability modifier (only for risk)
  const stabilityModifier = direction === 'risk'
    ? getStabilityModifier(targetEntity.stabilityLevel)
    : 1.0;

  // Coverage modifier (only for risk)
  const coverageModifier = direction === 'risk'
    ? getTestCoverageModifier(targetEntity)
    : 1.0;

  // Usage frequency modifier (only for benefit)
  const usageModifier = direction === 'benefit'
    ? Math.log10(Math.max(1, edge.callFrequency ?? 1))
    : 1.0;

  return baseFactor * couplingModifier * stabilityModifier * coverageModifier * usageModifier;
}
```

## Cross-Graph Propagation Rules

### Graph Types in Librarian

From RESEARCH-003:
1. **Code Graph**: Functions, modules, files with calls/imports/extends edges
2. **Rationale Graph**: Decisions, ADRs, justifications
3. **Epistemic Graph**: Claims, evidence, confidence, defeaters
4. **Organizational Graph**: Ownership, expertise, teams

### Cross-Graph Edge Types

| Source Graph | Target Graph | Edge Type | Propagation Direction |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Code | Rationale | `documented_by_decision` | Bidirectional |
| Code | Rationale | `constrained_by_decision` | Rationale → Code |
| Rationale | Epistemic | `justified_by_claim` | Epistemic → Rationale |

### Propagation Cascade Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Code Change → Rationale Invalidation**

```
1. Developer changes parseConfig() signature
2. Impact propagates to:
   - Direct callers (Code Graph)
   - ADR-007 which documents parseConfig design (Rationale Graph)
3. Rationale impact propagates to:
   - Claims justifying ADR-007 (Epistemic Graph)
   - Other code constrained by ADR-007 (back to Code Graph)
```

**Scenario 2: Epistemic Defeat → Code Risk**

```
1. Evidence shows Claim C1 ("JWT tokens never expire") is false
2. Claim C1 is defeated → propagates to dependent claims
3. ADR-012 which assumes C1 is invalidated
4. All code constrained by ADR-012 needs review
5. Risk propagates to callers of that code
```

**Scenario 3: Ownership Change → Epistemic Uncertainty**

```
1. Primary author of auth/ leaves the company
2. Ownership concentration increases (truck factor risk)
3. Epistemic confidence in auth/ claims decreases
4. ADRs about auth/ architecture need revalidation
5. Code depending on auth/ assumptions has elevated risk
```

### Cross-Graph Propagation Factors

| Cross-Graph Edge | Risk Factor | Benefit Factor | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Code → Rationale (documented_by) | 0.7 | 0.3 | Code changes may invalidate rationale |
| Rationale → Code (constrained_by) | 0.8 | 0.4 | Rationale changes constrain code choices |
| Rationale → Epistemic (justified_by) | 0.6 | 0.2 | Rationale validity depends on claims |
| Epistemic → Rationale (assumes) | 0.9 | 0.3 | Assumptions are fragile |
| Code → Epistemic (verified_by) | 0.4 | 0.6 | Tests can verify but also break |
| Code ↔ Org (owned_by) | 0.3 | 0.1 | Organizational context |

### Cross-Graph Propagation Algorithm

```python
def cross_graph_propagation(
    source: MultiGraphNode,
    direction: 'risk' | 'benefit'
) -> Dict[MultiGraphNode, float]:
    """
    Propagate impact across all graph types.
    """
    impact = {source: 1.0}
    visited = set()
    queue = [(source, 1.0)]

    while queue:
        node, current_impact = queue.pop(0)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)

        # Get edges in current graph
        for edge in get_edges(node, same_graph=True):
            factor = calculate_propagation_factor(edge, direction, node, edge.target)
            propagated = current_impact * factor
            if propagated > THRESHOLD:
                update_impact(impact, edge.target, propagated)
                queue.append((edge.target, propagated))

        # Get cross-graph edges
        for cross_edge in get_cross_graph_edges(node):
            # Apply cross-graph transition penalty
            factor = CROSS_GRAPH_FACTORS[cross_edge.type][direction]
            propagated = current_impact * factor * CROSS_GRAPH_PENALTY
            if propagated > THRESHOLD:
                update_impact(impact, cross_edge.target, propagated)
                queue.append((cross_edge.target, propagated))

    return impact

# Cross-graph penalty: propagation decays when crossing graph boundaries
CROSS_GRAPH_PENALTY = 0.8
```

### Handling Circular Cross-Graph Dependencies

```
Code:parseConfig()
  → documented_by → Rationale:ADR-007
    → justified_by → Epistemic:Claim-C1
      → verified_by → Code:test_parseConfig()
        → tests → Code:parseConfig()  // CYCLE!
```

**Solution**: Track visited nodes globally across all graphs, not per-graph.

## Visualization for Agents

### Text-Based Visualization (For LLM Agents)

```
CASCADING IMPACT ANALYSIS: Breaking parseConfig()
================================================

Source: src/config/parser.ts::parseConfig
Impact Direction: RISK
Total Nodes Affected: 47
Risk Level: HIGH (score: 78/100)

IMPACT BY DEPTH:
  Depth 0 (Source): parseConfig
  Depth 1 (Direct): 8 nodes, max impact 0.85
    ├── loadConfiguration (0.85) [calls]
    ├── validateConfig (0.82) [calls]
    └── ... 6 more
  Depth 2 (Transitive): 23 nodes, max impact 0.72
  Depth 3 (Transitive): 16 nodes, max impact 0.58

CRITICAL PATHS:
  1. parseConfig → loadConfiguration → startServer → main
     Impact: 0.68, Risk: Application startup fails

  2. parseConfig → validateConfig → deploymentCheck → CI/CD
     Impact: 0.62, Risk: Deployment pipeline breaks

CROSS-GRAPH IMPACTS:
  CODE → RATIONALE: ADR-007 (Configuration Management)
    Impact: 0.54, The design rationale may be invalidated

  RATIONALE → EPISTEMIC: Claim-C3 (Config is always valid JSON)
    Impact: 0.43, This assumption may no longer hold

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  [CRITICAL] Run test suite: tests/config/*.test.ts (8 tests)
  [HIGH] Notify reviewers: @alice, @bob (primary owners)
  [MEDIUM] Validate ADR-007 still applies
  [LOW] Update documentation in docs/config.md
```

### Structured Output for Tool Use

```json
{
  "source": {
    "id": "parseConfig",
    "path": "src/config/parser.ts",
    "graph": "code"
  },
  "summary": {
    "riskLevel": "high",
    "riskScore": 78,

    {
      "type": "run_tests",
      "target": "tests/config/*.test.ts",
      "priority": "critical"
    },
    {
      "type": "notify",
      "target": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"],
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ],
  "impactTree": {
    "id": "parseConfig",
    "impact": 1.0,
    "children": [

        "edgeType": "calls",
        "children": [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Mermaid Diagram Generation

```typescript
function generateMermaidDiagram(result: CascadeResult): string {
  const lines: string[] = ['graph TD'];

  // Add nodes with impact-based styling
  for (const node of result.impactByGraph.code.slice(0, 20)) {
    const style = getNodeStyle(node.impactScore);
    lines.push(`  ${node.id}["${node.label}"]:::${style}`);
  }

  // Add edges
  for (const node of result.impactByGraph.code.slice(0, 20)) {
    for (const edge of node.contributingEdges.slice(0, 3)) {
      lines.push(`  ${edge.fromId} -->|${edge.edgeType}| ${node.id}`);
    }
  }

  // Add styles
  lines.push('  classDef critical fill:#ff6b6b');
  lines.push('  classDef high fill:#ffd93d');
  lines.push('  classDef medium fill:#6bcb77');
  lines.push('  classDef low fill:#4d96ff');

  return lines.join('\n');
}
```

Generated diagram:
```mermaid
graph TD
  parseConfig["parseConfig()"]:::critical
  loadConfiguration["loadConfiguration()"]:::high
  validateConfig["validateConfig()"]:::high
  startServer["startServer()"]:::medium

  parseConfig -->|calls| loadConfiguration
  parseConfig -->|calls| validateConfig
  loadConfiguration -->|calls| startServer

  classDef critical fill:#ff6b6b
  classDef high fill:#ffd93d
  classDef medium fill:#6bcb77
```

### Agent-Optimized Summary

For agents with limited context windows:

```typescript
function generateAgentSummary(result: CascadeResult): string {
  const critical = result.impactByGraph.code.filter(n => n.impactScore > 0.7);
  const high = result.impactByGraph.code.filter(n => n.impactScore > 0.5 && n.impactScore <= 0.7);

  return `
IMPACT: ${result.direction.toUpperCase()} on ${result.source.label}
RISK: ${result.recommendations.filter(r => r.priority === 'critical').length > 0 ? 'HIGH' : 'MEDIUM'}

MUST ADDRESS:
${critical.slice(0, 5).map(n => `- ${n.label}: ${n.impactReason}`).join('\n')}

SHOULD CHECK:
${high.slice(0, 5).map(n => `- ${n.label}`).join('\n')}

ACTIONS: ${result.recommendations.filter(r => r.priority === 'critical').map(r => r.message).join('; ')}
`.trim();
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Algorithm | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Single-source cascade | Spreading Activation | O(E) worst, O(E_sig) typical | E_sig = edges above threshold |
| Single-source cascade | Personalized PageRank | O(E * iter) | iter typically 20-50 |
| Multi-source cascade | Spreading Activation | O(k * E_sig) | k = number of sources |
| Precompute metrics | PageRank + Betweenness | O(n² + n*E) | One-time, during indexing |
| Cross-graph cascade | Spreading Activation | O(E_total) | E_total = edges across all graphs |

### Space Complexity

| Data Structure | Space | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Impact scores | O(n_affected) | Only affected nodes stored |
| Propagation queue | O(width) | Width of BFS frontier |
| Visited set | O(n_affected) | To prevent cycles |
| Precomputed metrics | O(n) | PageRank, betweenness per node |

### Scalability Thresholds

| Graph Size | Recommended Approach | Expected Latency |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| < 1,000 nodes | Full spreading activation | < 50ms |
| 1,000 - 10,000 nodes | Threshold pruning | < 200ms |
| 10,000 - 100,000 nodes | Precomputed + adaptive depth | < 500ms |
| > 100,000 nodes | Sampling (RWR) + precomputed | < 1s |

### Memory Bounds

```typescript
const CASCADE_CONFIG = {
  // Maximum nodes to track in impact map
  maxImpactNodes: 1000,

  // Maximum frontier size before pruning
  maxFrontierSize: 500,

  // Minimum impact to continue propagation
  impactThreshold: 0.01,

  // Maximum depth before stopping
  maxDepth: 10,

  // Memory budget (approximate)
  memoryBudgetMB: 50,
};
```

## Key Insights

### Insight 1: Directional Asymmetry Matters

Benefits and risks both propagate upstream (to callers), but with different semantics and factors. A single "propagation factor" table is insufficient; you need separate risk and benefit factors.

### Insight 2: Cross-Graph Propagation is Essential

Code changes rarely stay in the code graph. They invalidate rationale, create epistemic uncertainty, and affect organizational knowledge. A complete cascade analysis must cross graph boundaries.

### Insight 3: Threshold Pruning is Key to Tractability

Without pruning, cascade analysis is O(n) or worse. With threshold pruning (ignoring impacts < 1%), analysis typically touches only 5-10% of the graph while capturing 95%+ of significant impact.

### Insight 4: Precomputation Enables Fast Queries

PageRank and betweenness centrality can be precomputed during indexing. This enables O(1) "quick estimates" for high-centrality nodes that would otherwise require expensive traversal.

### Insight 5: Visualization for Agents is Critical

LLM agents need impact information in digestible formats: prioritized lists, critical paths, and actionable recommendations. Raw graphs are not useful.
