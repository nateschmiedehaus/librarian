## Technique Primitives Alignment

The technique_library.ts provides 130+ technique primitives. Here's how they map to role needs:

| Role | Well-Covered Primitives | Missing Primitives |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Developer | tp_bisect, tp_min_repro, tp_root_cause, tp_hypothesis | tp_live_debug, tp_completion_context |
| Architect | tp_arch_mapping, tp_arch_invariant_scan, tp_dependency_map | tp_visual_arch, tp_drift_realtime |
| QA/Tester | tp_edge_case_catalog, tp_test_gap_analysis, tp_review_tests | tp_test_gen, tp_property_test |
| DevOps/SRE | tp_incident_timeline, tp_slo_definition, tp_release_plan | tp_prod_metrics, tp_runbook_link |
| Security Engineer | tp_threat_model, tp_security_abuse_cases, tp_secret_scan | tp_sast_correlation, tp_cve_path |
| Tech Lead | tp_ownership_matrix, tp_decision_review, tp_calibration_check | tp_pr_checklist, tp_skill_gap |
| Product Manager | tp_ux_journey (partial) | tp_plain_summary, tp_effort_estimate |
| Data Scientist | tp_data_lineage, tp_data_quality_audit | tp_feature_store, tp_experiment_track |
| Documentation Writer | tp_research_synthesis | tp_example_gen |
| New Team Member | tp_repo_map, tp_ownership_hints | tp_learning_path |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)

1. **Add Product Manager support primitives**
   - Create `tp_plain_language_summary` technique
   - Add UC-311: "Generate non-technical feature summary"
   - Add UC-312: "Estimate feature effort in business terms"

2. **Enhance DevOps/SRE support**
   - Create `tp_runbook_code_link` technique
   - Add UC-313: "Link production alerts to runbooks and code"

3. **Improve Security Engineer tooling**
   - Add UC-314: "Map CVE IDs to affected code paths"
   - Integrate with existing SBOM support (UC-286)

### Short-Term (Next Quarter)

4. **QA/Tester enhancement**
   - Research test generation from specifications
   - Add property-based testing primitives

5. **Data Scientist support**
   - Add feature store integration primitives
   - Add experiment tracking context retrieval

6. **IDE Integration planning**
   - Design inline knowledge delivery API
   - Plan VS Code/JetBrains extension architecture

### Long-Term (6+ Months)

7. **Real-time capabilities**
   - Architecture drift detection
   - Production metrics correlation
   - Live debugging context

8. **Visualization layer**
   - Architecture diagrams
   - User impact visualization
   - Feature dependency graphs

## Conclusion

Librarian's USE_CASE_MATRIX provides **strong foundational coverage** for code-centric roles (Developer, Architect, Tech Lead, Documentation Writer, New Team Member) with 80%+ coverage. However, **significant gaps exist** for:

1. **Product Manager** (52% coverage) - Needs non-technical abstraction layer
2. **DevOps/SRE** (68% coverage) - Needs production/runtime context integration
3. **Data Scientist** (65% coverage) - Needs ML-specific tooling integration

The technique primitives library is well-aligned with cognitive tasks but lacks primitives for:
- Non-technical communication
- Real-time production correlation
- ML/Data-specific workflows

**Recommended next step**: Prioritize Product Manager and DevOps/SRE gaps as these represent the largest underserved populations in typical engineering organizations.
