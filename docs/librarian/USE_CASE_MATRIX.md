# Librarian Use-Case Matrix (Canonical)

Status: authoritative
Scope: Exhaustive UC-to-method coverage map for knowledge and understanding needs.
Last Verified: 2026-01-04
Owner: librarianship
Version: 1.1.0
Evidence: docs only (implementation evidence lives in STATUS.md)

## Related Documents

| Document | Relationship |
|----------|-------------|
| `SCHEMAS.md` | Type definitions for GapReport, UCRequirementSet |
| `STATUS.md` | Implementation tracking per UC |
| `UNDERSTANDING_LAYER.md` | Knowledge schema and confidence |
| `validation.md` | Test coverage per scenario |
| `scenarios.md` | Scenario definitions |

## Purpose
Provide a comprehensive, dependency-aware map of knowledge and understanding needs
for any codebase, project, or problem-solving context, and map each need to the
Librarian architecture and pipelines that satisfy it. This matrix is a core
contract: every row must be backed by LLM-derived understanding or explicitly
marked as planned.

## Non-Negotiables
- LLM understanding is mandatory for semantic claims; no non-LLM shortcuts.
- Dependencies must be explicit; layered needs reference prerequisite rows.
- Every row must cite architecture or planned architecture sections.
- Status must be accurate (verified, partial, planned) with evidence.
- Language support is immediate: new languages trigger onboarding flow.
- Method catalog is integrated below and must stay aligned with UC coverage.
- Librarian must supply method-ready knowledge and hints for all listed methods.
- Each UC inherits domain defaults (maps, methods, evidence, scenarios) unless explicitly overridden.
- UC coverage must be audit-ready against UC x Method x Scenario (see Coverage Audit Checklist).
- **Constructability rule**: each UC must be satisfiable by one or more **construction templates** (not bespoke endpoints). The mapping lives in the construction registry described in `docs/librarian/specs/core/knowledge-construction.md`.

## Dependency Layers (Required)
Use-case coverage is layered. Dependencies flow from lower layers to higher layers.

| L1 (Structure) | UC-031-060 | Navigation, behavior, architectural structure |
| L2 (Change + Risk) | UC-041-170 | Impact, data, build/test, runtime, security, reliability |
| L3 (Coordination + Synthesis) | UC-171-260 | Language, multi-repo, product/project, agentic, synthesis |
| L4 (Context + Execution) | UC-261-310 | Token-budgeted repo maps, executable verification workflows, supply-chain/infra extensions |

## Problem-Solving Method Catalog (Integrated)
The method catalog is part of this file so use-case coverage and methods
remain aligned. Methods use the same mechanism codes as the UC matrix.

### Method Support Contract (Required)
- Librarian must provide the knowledge inputs needed to apply each method
  in any relevant scenario (evidence, constraints, risks, alternatives).
- Librarian must provide fast method hints and reminders to agents based on
  UC requirements and task context.
- Method hints should be preloaded when cheap and cached dynamically when
  usage frequency or workflow templates indicate value.
- If a method cannot be supported fully, emit a GapReport and mark coverage
  as partial with required inputs.

## Coverage Audit Checklist (Required)

Every UC must be covered by at least one method family and one scenario.
This checklist is the human-readable companion to the formal audit in
`docs/librarian/validation.md`.

Checklist:
- UC -> Method coverage exists (UC inherits a method family via its domain).
- UC -> Scenario coverage exists (scenario family mapped or explicit UC override).
- UC -> Evidence sources recorded (evidence pack, traces, provider).
- UC -> Confidence and defeaters surfaced in response.
- UC -> GapReport emitted when coverage is partial or missing.

## Measurement Framework per UC Cluster (Required)

Each UC cluster must have defined measurement criteria. Measurement replaces
binary pass/fail with continuous quality metrics.

### Measurement Procedure per Cluster

```typescript
interface ClusterMeasurement {
  clusterId: string;           // e.g., "Orientation"
  ucRange: [number, number];   // e.g., [1, 10]

  // Primary metric
  primaryMetric: {
    name: string;              // e.g., "Bootstrap coverage"
    target: number;            // e.g., 0.90
    current: number;           // Measured value
    passing: boolean;          // current >= target
  };

  // Secondary metrics
  secondaryMetrics: Array<{
    name: string;
    value: number;
    trend: 'improving' | 'degrading' | 'stable';
  }>;

  // Per-UC breakdown
  ucBreakdown: Array<{
    ucId: string;
    metricValue: number;
    status: 'PASS' | 'FAIL' | 'PARTIAL';
    blockers?: string[];
  }>;

  // Measurement metadata
  measuredAt: string;          // ISO 8601
  sampleSize: number;
  confidence: number;          // 0.0-1.0
}
```

### Measurement Cadence

| Cluster Type | Frequency | Trigger |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Foundation (L0) | Every bootstrap | Bootstrap completion |
| Structure (L1) | Daily | Cron job |
| Change/Risk (L2) | On demand | Major changes |
| Synthesis (L3) | Weekly | Scheduled audit |

Audit artifact requirement:
- `state/audits/librarian/coverage/uc_method_scenario_matrix.json`
- PASS/FAIL for every UC x method family x scenario mapping, with evidence links.

## PASS/FAIL Criteria (Required)

Each cell in the UC x Method x Scenario matrix must be evaluated using these criteria.

### PASS Criteria

A UC x Method x Scenario cell is marked PASS when ALL of the following are true:

1. **Knowledge Available**: Librarian can produce the knowledge required by the UC
2. **Method Supported**: Librarian provides inputs needed to apply the method
3. **Scenario Executed**: The scenario has been executed with real providers
4. **Evidence Captured**: EvidencePack.v1 artifact exists with:
   - `provider` and `modelId` fields populated
   - `promptDigest` and `responseDigest` for reproducibility
   - `timestamp` within freshness threshold (default: 7 days)
5. **Confidence Threshold Met**: Overall confidence >= 0.6
6. **No Active Defeaters**: No defeaters with severity >= "high" are active
7. **No Heuristic-Only**: Output was LLM-backed, not heuristic fallback

### FAIL Criteria

A cell is marked FAIL if ANY of the following are true:

1. **Knowledge Unavailable**: UC cannot be satisfied with current implementation
2. **Method Unsupported**: Required method inputs are missing
3. **Scenario Not Executed**: No evidence of execution
4. **Evidence Missing**: No EvidencePack.v1 or incomplete fields
5. **Low Confidence**: Overall confidence < 0.4
6. **Critical Defeater**: Active defeater with severity = "critical"
7. **Heuristic Only**: Output is heuristic-only, violating LLM mandate

### PARTIAL Criteria

A cell is marked PARTIAL when:

1. Some but not all PASS criteria are met
2. Confidence is between 0.4 and 0.6
3. Active defeaters exist but severity < "high"
4. Evidence exists but is stale (> 7 days)

### Audit Output Schema

```typescript
interface CoverageAuditCell {
  ucId: string;           // e.g., "UC-001"
  methodFamily: string;   // e.g., "MF-01"
  scenarioId: string;     // e.g., "bootstrap_success"
  status: 'PASS' | 'FAIL' | 'PARTIAL';
  evidence?: {
    packPath: string;     // Path to EvidencePack.v1
    confidence: number;
    defeaterCount: number;
    executedAt: string;   // ISO 8601
  };
  failureReasons?: string[];
  notes?: string;
}

interface CoverageAuditReport {
  kind: 'CoverageAuditReport.v1';
  schemaVersion: 1;
  generatedAt: string;
  scope: string;
  cells: CoverageAuditCell[];
  summary: {
    total: number;
    pass: number;
    fail: number;
    partial: number;
    coverage: number;     // pass / total
  };
}
```

## Dependency Validation Rules (Required)

Dependencies between UCs must be validated before execution. These rules ensure
correct ordering and prevent false positives from running UCs without prerequisites.

### Dependency Graph Rules

1. **Acyclicity**: The dependency graph must be acyclic. If A depends on B, B cannot depend on A.
2. **Transitivity**: If A depends on B and B depends on C, A implicitly depends on C.
3. **Layer Ordering**: UCs can only depend on same-layer or lower-layer UCs:
   - L3 can depend on L0, L1, L2, L3
   - L2 can depend on L0, L1, L2
   - L1 can depend on L0, L1
   - L0 can only depend on L0

### Dependency Validation Checks

Before executing a UC, validate:

```typescript
interface DependencyValidation {
  ucId: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  checks: {
    allDependenciesExist: boolean;      // All referenced UC IDs are valid
    noCycles: boolean;                  // No circular dependencies
    layerOrderValid: boolean;           // Dependencies respect layer ordering
    dependenciesSatisfied: boolean;     // All dependencies have PASS status
  };
  canExecute: boolean;                   // True only if all checks pass
  blockedBy?: string[];                  // UC IDs blocking execution
}
```

### Dependency Failure Handling

1. **Missing Dependency**: Emit `GapReport.v1` with `category: 'missing_dependency'`
2. **Cycle Detected**: Abort validation and emit error
3. **Layer Violation**: Warn but allow execution with note
4. **Dependency Not Satisfied**: Block execution, record blocker UCs

### Dependency Satisfaction States

| State | Definition | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| `satisfied` | Dependency UC has PASS status | Proceed |
| `partial` | Dependency UC has PARTIAL status | Warn, proceed with confidence penalty |
| `unsatisfied` | Dependency UC has FAIL status | Block, emit GapReport |
| `missing` | Dependency UC does not exist | Block, emit GapReport |

### Layer Integrity Check

Run before any coverage audit:

```bash
# Validate all dependencies respect layer ordering
npm run librarian -- validate-deps --strict

# Output: DependencyValidationReport.v1 in state/audits/
```
