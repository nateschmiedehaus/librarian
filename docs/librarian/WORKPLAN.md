# Librarian Work Plan

Status: partial
Scope: phases, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and evidence gates.
Last Verified: 2026-01-04
Owner: librarianship
Evidence: docs only (implementation evidence lives in STATUS.md)

## Guiding Rules
- No MVP shortcuts. Every phase has evidence gates.
- Provider checks are mandatory for live semantic behavior.
- Every claim must link to tests, traces, or audits.
- Doc updates precede implementation changes.
- Implementation sequencing follows `docs/librarian/IMPLEMENTATION_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`.

## Phase 0: Documentation Canon (Now)
Goal: single source of truth, coherent doc architecture, and complete research consolidation.
Acceptance:
- Canonical doc set exists with required headers and ownership boundaries.
- Directory architecture (docs + code) documented and aligned.
- Scenario taxonomy and understanding layer are defined and cross-linked.
- Use-case matrix (250+ needs) is authored with dependencies and citations.
- Problem-solving method catalog (200+) is authored and integrated into USE_CASE_MATRIX.md.
- Packaging/onboarding guide exists for injection into any repo.
- Legacy research integrated into canonical docs or archived with pointers.
- Full wiring inventory documented in PIPELINES_AND_WIRING.md.
- Retrieval method stack documented in UNDERSTANDING_LAYER.md.
- Language onboarding policy documented (immediate support).
- Open-source extension points documented.
Evidence:
- `docs/librarian/DOCS_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/librarian/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/librarian/UNDERSTANDING_LAYER.md`
- `docs/librarian/scenarios.md`
- `docs/librarian/USE_CASE_MATRIX.md`
- `docs/librarian/PACKAGING_AND_ONBOARDING.md`

## Phase 1: Model Policy + Provider Gating
Goal: daily model selection and enforced provider readiness.
Dependencies: Phase 0.
Acceptance:
- Model policy documented and wired to runtime (daily fetch + audit).
- Provider check blocks runs when unavailable.
- Librarian defaults to cheapest SOTA tier (Haiku-class) unless proven insufficient.
- Provider unavailability errors include `unverified_by_trace(provider_unavailable)` and fail closed.
- Waiting is the default: no timeouts for required LLM operations unless explicitly configured.
Evidence gates:
- `docs/librarian/MODEL_POLICY.md`
- `ensureDailyModelSelection()` writes audits in `state/audits/model_selection/`
- `checkAllProviders()` enforced before bootstrap and queries

## Phase 2: Core Pipelines + Event Wiring
Goal: single end-to-end wiring path with shared primitives and event bus.
Dependencies: Phase 1.
Acceptance:
- One query pipeline (normalize -> freshness -> lock -> execute -> confidence).
- One ingestion pipeline with shared primitives and event emission.
- Embedding pipeline uses EmbeddingService only (no mocks).
- Retrieval pipeline wires multi-vector, co-change, and rerank signals end-to-end.
- Multi-vector representations are persisted with vector-kind metadata and query-time weights.
- Storage schema supports understanding + maps + audits.
- Language onboarding pipeline wired (detect -> adapter -> fallback -> reindex).
- Parser registry provides fallback extraction for unknown languages (no hard fail; GapReport emitted).
- LLM-only parsing fallback for unknown languages (functions + dependencies; no regex).
- Co-change edges computed during bootstrap (not only via Wave0 integration).
- Engine toolkit results (relevance/constraints/meta) included in query responses.
- Persistent query cache wired (L2 + SQLite) and verified.
- Workspace-aware dependency resolution (monorepo aliases + package boundaries) wired into ingest and graph edges.
- Edge-case ingestion handled (symlinks, binary, vendor, partial clones).
Evidence gates:
- `docs/librarian/PIPELINES_AND_WIRING.md`
- Wiring tests for event bus and query pipeline
- Storage migrations verified

## Phase 3: Agent + Orchestrator Integration
Goal: context assembly, scheduling, and multi-agent coordination are librarian-driven.
Dependencies: Phase 2.
Acceptance:
- Context assembly uses librarian queries with evidence and confidence.
- Scheduler uses semantic signals and expertise matching.
- File watcher triggers incremental reindex and context invalidation.
- Locks prevent multi-agent conflicts and stale writes.
Evidence gates:
- Integration tests for `preOrchestrationHook` and `enrichTaskContext`
- Agent pool/scheduler wiring verified against librarian signals

## Phase 4: Knowledge Construction + Scenario Coverage
Goal: knowledge mappings and scenario responses are complete and tested.
Dependencies: Phase 3.
Acceptance:
- Knowledge mappings exist for all domains in UNDERSTANDING_LAYER.
- Understanding synthesis generates purpose/mechanism/contract with evidence.
- Scenario taxonomy has working query paths for high-priority cases.
- Use-case matrix rows map to scenarios or explicit planned coverage.
- Method hints are generated and attached for relevant UC requirements.
- Method pack cache and preloading are implemented for frequent methods.
- Knowledge gaps are surfaced with explicit next actions.
- LLM-backed rationale and security extraction used for semantic knowledge; heuristic-only outputs flagged partial.
- File and directory semantic extraction uses LLM (no heuristic-only fallbacks).
- New-language scenarios produce usable outputs with explicit gaps.
- Knowledge map outputs are included in context packs or knowledge sources.
- Knowledge-source summaries are LLM-synthesized and include evidence + map-code references.
Evidence gates:
- Scenario tests for onboarding, change impact, security, refactor, CI failures
- Understanding schema validation with evidence traces

## Phase 5: Validation + Operations
Goal: prove system correctness with deterministic and agentic tests and run reliably daily.
Dependencies: Phase 4.
Acceptance:
- Tier-0 deterministic gate passes.
- Agentic audits produce evidence or fail with unverified_by_trace.
- Daily model selection runs with logs.
- Staleness, locking, and recovery validated.
- Bootstrap timeout handling and recovery state validated (wait by default).
- Open-source governance published (extension points + contribution gates).
- Usability readiness: CLI errors and progress are actionable and consistent.
- Coverage audit emits UC x Method x Scenario matrix with explicit PASS/FAIL.
- Scenario output baselines include expected-vs-actual diff reports and stress-test traces.
Evidence gates:
- `docs/librarian/validation.md`
- `docs/librarian/AUDIT.md`
- Run logs in `state/audits/`
- Reliability metrics documented
