# World-Class Librarian Initiative

> **Goal**: Make Librarian genuinely indispensable for any agent working on any codebase
> **Priority**: Quality over speed. Comprehensive over fast. Correct over convenient.
> **Status**: Active Development

---

## Core Principles

1. **Handle ANYTHING**: With appropriate constructables and configs, Librarian must provide value for any task
2. **Automatic Intelligence**: Librarian should auto-configure and auto-recommend, not require manual setup
3. **Zero Friction Integration**: Agents should use Librarian without thinking about it
4. **Evidence-Based Everything**: Every claim, recommendation, and action must be backed by verifiable evidence
5. **Full Tier by Default**: No MVP shortcuts in production—comprehensive analysis always

## Work Unit Registry

### WU-WORLD-001: Full Tier Upgrade
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)
**Status**: In Progress

Upgrade default quality tier from MVP to FULL:
- [ ] Hierarchical summaries (module → file → function)
- [ ] Cross-project learning enabled
- [ ] Full graph analysis (not sampled)
- [ ] Complete pattern detection (all T-series patterns)
- [ ] Deep relationship mapping (3+ hops)

**Deliverable**: `npm run bootstrap` produces FULL tier by default

---

### WU-WORLD-002: Automatic Agent Integration
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)
**Status**: Planned

Make agents use Librarian automatically without manual queries:

1. **Pre-Task Context Injection**
   - Detect task intent from user message
   - Query Librarian for relevant context
   - Inject context into agent's working memory
   - No agent action required

2. **Post-Task Outcome Recording**
   - Monitor tool calls and file changes
   - Automatically record outcomes
   - Feed calibration system
   - Learn from every interaction

3. **Continuous Context Refresh**
   - Watch for relevant file changes during task
   - Update context as codebase evolves
   - Alert agent to breaking changes

**Deliverable**: Agents work better with Librarian present, even without explicit queries

---

### WU-WORLD-003: Documentation as First-Class Knowledge
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)
**Status**: Planned

Index and retrieve documentation with same rigor as code:

1. **Document Entity Types**
   - README files → Project overview entities
   - AGENTS.md → Agent instruction entities
   - ADR files → Decision record entities
   - API docs → Contract entities
   - Comments → Inline knowledge entities

2. **Semantic Document Understanding**
   - Extract structured knowledge from prose
   - Link documentation to code entities
   - Detect doc/code drift
   - Generate doc coverage reports

3. **Query Routing**
   - Meta-queries ("how to use X") → Documentation
   - Implementation queries ("where is X") → Code
   - Hybrid queries → Both

**Deliverable**: Query "how should an agent use Librarian?" returns integration docs, not random functions

---

### WU-WORLD-004: Intelligent Auto-Configuration
**Priority**: P1 (Important)
**Status**: Planned

Librarian configures itself optimally for each codebase:

1. **Language/Framework Detection**
   - Auto-detect: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, etc.
   - Framework-specific extractors (React, Django, etc.)
   - Test framework detection (Jest, Pytest, etc.)

2. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Monorepo vs single-project
   - Package boundaries
   - Build system detection

3. **Constructable Recommendations**
   - Suggest appropriate constructions for project type
   - Auto-enable relevant pattern detectors
   - Configure domain-specific extractors

4. **Config Generation**
   - Generate `.librarian/config.json` with optimal settings
   - Explain each setting's purpose
   - Allow override with justification

**Deliverable**: `librarian bootstrap` auto-configures perfectly for any project type

### WU-WORLD-006: Evidence-Backed Confidence
**Priority**: P1 (Important)
**Status**: Planned

Every confidence score must be justified:

1. **Calibration Pipeline**
   - Collect prediction/outcome pairs automatically
   - Compute ECE, MCE, Brier scores
   - Alert on calibration drift

2. **Evidence Chains**
   - Every claim links to source evidence
   - Evidence has provenance (AST, test, doc, inference)
   - Chains are auditable

3. **Defeater Tracking**
   - Detect when evidence is invalidated
   - Propagate invalidation to dependent claims
   - Mark stale knowledge explicitly

4. **Uncertainty Disclosure**
   - Never present uncertain claims as certain
   - Disclose calibration error in responses
   - Suggest verification for low-confidence claims

**Deliverable**: Confidence scores are trustworthy and actionable

---

### WU-WORLD-007: Intelligent Query Understanding
**Priority**: P1 (Important)
**Status**: Planned

Understand query intent, not just keywords:

1. **Intent Classification**
   - Understanding queries ("what does X do?")
   - Implementation queries ("how to implement X")
   - Navigation queries ("where is X")
   - Debugging queries ("why does X fail")
   - Architecture queries ("how is X structured")

2. **Context-Aware Retrieval**
   - Consider current file/cursor position
   - Weight recently edited files
   - Factor in task context

3. **Clarification Requests**
