**Goal**: Make wave0 the world's best autonomous multi-agent orchestration and software development tool, with librarian as its knowledge backbone.

---

## ✅ AUTH WIRING VERIFIED

Librarian now uses Wave0's CLI-only auth checks (AuthChecker + LLMService health probes).
See [REMAINING_WORK.md#r0](./REMAINING_WORK.md#r0-fix-provider-auth-wiring) for verification steps.

## 🚨 CURRENT STATUS (2025-12-30)

**Overall**: ~85% complete with real implementations (not stubs).

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Core algorithms | ✅ Complete (Tarjan's SCC, PageRank, SBFL, DOA) |
| Storage layer | ✅ Complete (SQLite with WAL, 1,826 lines) |
| Wave0 integration | ✅ 5 integration points wired |
| Engine toolkit | ✅ Relevance, Constraint, Meta-Knowledge engines implemented |
| Test coverage | ⚠️ 94/109 passing (15 skip due to auth bug) |
| Auth wiring | ✅ **WIRED** — provider gate uses Wave0 CLI auth |

## LIBRARIAN ENGINE TOOLKIT

The librarian provides three core engines that transform it from a knowledge store into a reasoning system:

| Engine | Question Answered | Agent Use |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Relevance Engine** | "What do I need to know for this task?" | Context gathering, pattern finding, blast radius |
| **Constraint Engine** | "What rules apply and am I breaking them?" | Validation, boundary checking, exception handling |
| **Meta-Knowledge Engine** | "How confident should I be?" | Confidence scoring, staleness detection, failure attribution |

**Key Design Principle**: Engines support both **event-driven** (automatic) and **agent-initiated** (active query) modes.

See [implementation-requirements.md#librarian-engine-toolkit](./implementation-requirements.md#librarian-engine-toolkit) for:
- Complete TypeScript interfaces
- Trigger matrices (when engines fire)
- Agent query examples
- Failure modes and recovery
- Agentic testing specifications
