# Behavior Index (Spec System)

> **Status**: Canonical index
> **Created**: 2026-01-25
>
> **Goal**: Ensure the spec system describes **behavior under real conditions** (scenarios, edge cases, loads, repo types, dependency outages) — not only technical interfaces.
>
> **How to use**:
> 1. Pick the spec file you’re implementing.
> 2. Read its entry here first (behavioral contract + operational profiles).
> 3. Only then read the technical details in the spec file.
>
> **Profiles**: `docs/librarian/specs/core/operational-profiles.md`
>
> **Non-theater rule**: If a spec is marked `executable`, this index must point to at least one runnable verification hook.

## Status Legend

- **executable**: behavior is intended to run in production; must be evidence-gated.
- **design**: intended behavior is specified but not fully wired/verified.
- **research_only**: reference material; MUST NOT be treated as implemented behavior.

## Entry Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

Every spec file under `docs/librarian/specs/**` MUST have exactly one explicit entry in this index (a `###` heading with the file path), **except this file** (`docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md`) which is the index itself.

Every entry MUST include:
- `Status: ...`
- `Used for: ...` (how it is used by implementers/agents)
- `Behavior: ...` (what it does under conditions, or “reference-only”)

If `Status:` is `executable`, the entry MUST also include:
- `Verification: ...` (at least one runnable hook: Tier‑0 test, Tier‑1 skip test, Tier‑2 system test, gate task, or audit artifact generator)

## Core Specs

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/operational-profiles.md`
- Status: executable (spec meta)
- Used for: shared scenario taxonomy across the whole spec system.
- Behavior: defines repo/workload/dependency profiles + universal edge-case taxonomy.
- Verification: `src/librarian/__tests__/librarian_spec_behavior_index.test.ts` (index completeness).

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/performance-budgets.md`
- Status: design (targets)
- Used for: explicit latency/resource budgets by operational profile; prevents “performance implied” theater.
- Behavior (profiles): R0–R4; W0–W3; D0–D3; S0–S2.
- Edge cases: E2 oversized inputs must be budgeted; E7 timeouts must disclose partial results; E8 contention must be bounded/retriable.
- Verification: (design; becomes executable once Tier‑2 performance audit artifacts + gates exist).

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/testing-architecture.md`
- Status: executable
- Used for: tier policy (Tier‑0 deterministic, Tier‑1 provider-optional skip, Tier‑2 provider-required).
- Behavior (profiles): D0–D3; W0–W3.
- Edge cases: “skip theater” forbidden; Tier‑2 must fail fast with `unverified_by_trace(provider_unavailable)`.
- Verification: `docs/librarian/GATES.json` Tier‑0/1/2 tasks; package tests under `packages/librarian`.

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/evidence-ledger.md`
- Status: design (wiring incomplete)
- Used for: recording claim-affecting events across query/tool/provider execution.
- Behavior (profiles): W0/W1/W3; S0–S2; D0–D3.
- Edge cases: E7 provider outage evidence must still be appended; E8 storage contention must retry/backoff or fail closed; E6 stale evidence must be labeled.
- Key behaviors:
  - Append-only: never mutate/delete; batch append preferred under load.
  - Storage contention (S1): bounded retry/backoff OR fail closed with explicit disclosure (no silent drops).
  - Provider outage (D3): still logs the outage event; downstream stages must surface `provider_unavailable`.
- Verification: `packages/librarian/src/epistemics/__tests__/evidence_ledger.test.ts` and `src/librarian/__tests__/librarian_spec_drift_guards.test.ts`.

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/confidence-boundary.md`
- Status: design (migration incomplete)
- Used for: separating epistemic confidence (`ConfidenceValue`) from heuristic scores.
- Behavior (profiles): W0; E5/E6; D0–D3.
- Edge cases: E5 conflicting evidence becomes defeaters (not “averaged away”); E6 stale evidence triggers disclosure/decay; E7 provider outages must not invent confidence.
- Key behaviors:
  - Any **claim** confidence must be `ConfidenceValue`; heuristic ranking must not masquerade as confidence.
  - When calibration is absent: return `absent('uncalibrated')` and disclose uncertainty (no invented numbers).
- Verification: `packages/librarian/src/epistemics/__tests__/confidence.test.ts` and Track D specs.

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/primitive-contracts.md`
- Status: design
- Used for: verifiable pre/postconditions for technique primitives.
- Behavior (profiles): W0/W1; D0–D3.
- Edge cases: E7 provider outages must be tiered (Tier‑1 skip, Tier‑2 fail closed); E1 empty/malformed inputs must fail with contract violations.
- Key behaviors:
  - Preconditions gate execution; postconditions must be validated or surfaced as contract violations.
  - Provider-unavailable semantic checks must be tiered: Tier‑1 skip, Tier‑2 fail closed.
- Verification: technique contract bridge tests under `packages/librarian/src/api/__tests__/technique_contract_bridge.test.ts`.

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/work-objects.md`
- Status: executable
- Used for: defining the canonical “work objects” that compile knowledge into replayable execution (tasks/events/snapshots/context artifacts).
- Behavior (profiles): W0–W3; S0–S2; D0–D3.
- Edge cases: E7 provider outages must block provider-required DoD checks; E8 contention must not drop events; E6 stale evidence must be disclosed in task context.
- Key behaviors:
  - Append-only event stream is truth; snapshots are derived.
  - Plan mutations are explicit events with evidence refs (no silent plan drift).
  - DoD obligations gate “done”; Tier‑2-only provider checks must not appear in Tier‑0.
- Verification: `src/workgraph/__tests__/workgraph_runner.test.ts` and `src/workgraph/__tests__/workgraph_replay_pack.test.ts`.

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/knowledge-construction.md`
- Status: design
- Used for: the construction compiler and knowledge-object model that turns “anything an agent wants to know” into durable maps/claims/packs per project and per agent session.
- Behavior (profiles): R0–R4; W0–W3; D0–D3; S0–S2.
- Edge cases: E4 partial corpora, E6 stale evidence, E7 provider outage, E8 contention must all produce explicit disclosures (no silent degradation).
- Key behaviors:
  - Answers are produced via a recorded `ConstructionPlan` + adequacy report (coverage/freshness/semantic status).
  - Repo-scale context is served via `Maps` (includes token-budgeted `RepoMap`/`SymbolMap` packs).
  - Incremental refresh (W2/W3) invalidates dependent objects deterministically; stale reuse is disclosed.
  - Appendix A contains an explicit “100 things” list; UC‑261…UC‑310 are specified in the UC matrix and covered via construction templates (no bespoke handlers).
- Verification: (design; becomes executable once the registry completeness test + Tier‑2 construction suites are implemented).

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/construction-templates.md`
- Status: design
- Used for: the UC→template registry contract that prevents bespoke handler creep.
- Behavior (profiles): W0–W3; D0–D3; S0–S2.
- Edge cases: E4 partial corpora, E7 provider outage, E8 contention must surface as adequacy/disclosures; templates must never “omit unknowns”.
- Key behaviors:
  - Every UC must map to ≥1 template; template selection must be recorded in plan/trace.
  - Templates share a required output envelope (packs + adequacy + verification plan + disclosures).
- Verification: (design; becomes executable once the deterministic UC→template mapping test exists).

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/foundations.md`
- Status: design (extraction scaffold)
- Used for: foundational interfaces shared across tracks (Parts I–V extraction landing zone).
- Behavior: until extracted, any dependency on these foundations must disclose `unverified_by_trace(extraction_missing)`.

### `docs/librarian/specs/core/agent-coordination.md`
- Status: design
- Used for: multi-agent coordination semantics; conflict resolution; shared evidence.
- Behavior (profiles): W3; S1; E8.
- Edge cases: E8 storage contention and concurrent writes must not corrupt ledger; E5 conflicting writes must be surfaced (no silent overwrite).
- Key behaviors:
  - Multi-agent writes must be correlated (session/correlation IDs).
  - Conflicts must be surfaced as defeaters or explicit “needs review” items (no silent overwrite).
- Verification: (design; implemented behavior must add Tier‑0 correlation tests once wired).
