## How This Document Relates to the Librarian Story

Each chapter of the Librarian story (from AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) has implementation artifacts. This document tracks:
- **What Codex built** (prior implementation attempts)
- **What works** (verified, can rely on)
- **What's broken** (exists but doesn't work correctly)
- **What's missing** (not implemented yet)
- **Which spec covers the fix**

## Chapter 1: The Problem (Understanding Why)

**Story**: Agents need to *understand* code, not just search it.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Well-documented in THEORETICAL_CRITIQUE.md Parts I-IV

No code issues - this is foundational theory.

## Chapter 2: The Foundation (Layer 2 Infrastructure)

**Story**: We build infrastructure that captures evidence and negotiates capabilities.

**Known Issues**:
| Issue | Severity | File | Problem |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| Provider bypass | RESOLVED | `utils/llm_service.ts` | Fixed 2026-01-24: legacy singleton no longer auto-constructs; LLM usage must go through adapters |
| Non-uniform gating | MEDIUM | Various | Some call sites bypass `checkAllProviders()` |

**Spec**: `track-a-core-pipeline.md` Section P0

### 2.2 Evidence Ledger

| Aspect | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **MCP Audit Log** | ✅ Partial | `mcp/audit.ts` exists |
| **Episodes** | ✅ Partial | `episodes_state.ts` records episodes |
| **Query Stages** | ✅ Partial | `query.ts` logs stages |
| **Unified Ledger** | ⚠️ Partial | `epistemics/evidence_ledger.ts` exists; MCP server tool calls and provider gate now emit `tool_call` evidence, but wiring across query/episodes/technique execution is incomplete |
| **Deterministic Replay** | ❌ Missing | Cannot replay runs |

**Known Issues**:

## Priority Order for Fixes

Based on the Librarian story and dependencies:

### Tier 0: Build Must Pass
1. Fix missing exports (`telemetry/logger.js`, etc.)
2. Get typecheck gate green

### Tier 1: Foundation (Chapter 2)
3. Enforce LLM adapter gate (no direct `LLMService` instantiation outside adapters/tests)
4. Unify evidence ledger (connect MCP, episodes, query logs)

### Tier 2: Honesty (Chapter 5)
5. Migrate `technique_library.ts` to use `ConfidenceValue` (remove raw numbers and labeled-guess patterns)
6. Migrate `pattern_catalog.ts` to use `ConfidenceValue` (treat unknowns as `{ type: 'absent', reason: 'uncalibrated' }` until calibrated)
7. Keep specs aligned with `ConfidenceValue` (do not reintroduce labeled-guess confidence examples)

### Tier 3: Pipeline Verification (Chapter 3)
8. Implement non-no-op operator interpreters
9. Add evidence emission to execution engine
10. Verify end-to-end execution (Critical A)

### Tier 4: Learning Closure (Chapter 7)
11. Wire learning loop to selector
12. Add generative composition learning
