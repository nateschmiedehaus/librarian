# Librarian Spec System — Implementation Manual

> **Status**: Canonical (process)
> **Created**: 2026-01-25
>
> **Purpose**: This folder is the executable specification for Librarian’s future behavior. It is written so an implementer (human or agent) can implement the system with strict TDD, without guessing missing requirements.

---

## What “spec system” means here

- Specs must define **behavior under real conditions** (repo shape, workloads, outages, edge cases), not only interfaces and types.
- Any claim of “implemented / verified / supported” must be backed by a runnable evidence hook (Tier‑0 test, Tier‑1 skip test, Tier‑2 system test, gate task, or an audit artifact generator).
- If a capability is required and not available, Librarian must **fail closed** with an explicit `unverified_by_trace(...)` reason (no silent degradation).

This manual is the “how to implement these specs” page. The per-spec behavioral contracts are in `docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md`.

---

## Authority & precedence (stop drift)

This folder defines **the intended future behavior** of Librarian and how to implement it without guessing.

When documents disagree, resolve the conflict explicitly (do not “average” them):
- **Repo-global precedence** is declared in `config/canon.json` (see `doc_precedence`).
- **Within Librarian**:
  - **Current reality**: `docs/librarian/STATUS.md` (what exists and what is verified, with evidence).
  - **Future behavior spec**: `docs/librarian/specs/**` (this folder) + `docs/librarian/USE_CASE_MATRIX.md` (canonical UC inventory).
  - **Tie-break inside the spec system**: `docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md` + runnable verification hooks are authoritative until corrected.

Important: avoid absolutist guidance like “Librarian is non-functional without LLM” unless it is scoped to **semantic synthesis/claims**. Librarian may still provide deterministic maps/packs/adequacy disclosures in provider-degraded modes (see dependency profiles in `docs/librarian/specs/core/operational-profiles.md`).

---

## Non-negotiables (Wave0 constraints)

- **No fake embeddings / no deterministic semantic substitutes**
  - If embeddings are required and unavailable, fail closed with `unverified_by_trace(provider_unavailable)` (or Tier‑1 skip).
- **CLI-only auth**
  - Do not add API-key/env key checks; provider readiness must be evaluated via the provider gate (`checkAllProviders()` / `requireProviders()`).
- **No theater**
  - “Green without observation” is forbidden (e.g., returning early instead of a real skip; placeholder confidence; gates that don’t run anything).

## Priority 0: Extract Librarian First (Stop-the-line)

The spec system is the *future* Librarian: a standalone knowledge tool. To keep reality from drifting away from the spec, **full extraction from Wave0 is the top priority**.

Implement “essentials” inside the extracted Librarian package (or as minimal shims that preserve the boundary) rather than entangling Wave0 with Librarian internals.

Policy and evidence live in:
- `docs/librarian/specs/INTEGRATION_CHANGE_LIST.md` (Priority 0 section)
- `docs/librarian/GATES.json` (`layer1.*` extraction gates)

Authoritative policy docs (outside this folder):
- `docs/TEST.md`
- `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`
- `src/EMBEDDING_RULES.md`
- `docs/LIVE_PROVIDERS_PLAYBOOK.md`

---

## Reading order (implementation-first)

1. `docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md`
2. `docs/librarian/specs/core/operational-profiles.md`
3. `docs/librarian/specs/core/performance-budgets.md`
4. `docs/librarian/specs/core/testing-architecture.md`
5. `docs/librarian/specs/core/work-objects.md`
6. `docs/librarian/specs/core/knowledge-construction.md`
7. `docs/librarian/specs/core/construction-templates.md`
8. `docs/librarian/specs/INTEGRATION_CHANGE_LIST.md` and `docs/librarian/specs/IMPLEMENTATION_FAILURE_RCA.md`
9. Then the specific track/core spec(s) you’re implementing.

Rule: If a spec doc and the Behavior Index disagree about behavior/status, treat the Behavior Index + runnable evidence as authoritative until corrected.

## Full Build Charter (Council of 30) — what “done” means (world‑class)

This section is the spec-system’s “world‑class target contract”. It is intentionally strict and evidence-driven.

### Definition of done (full build; not MVP)

Librarian is “full build” only when ALL are true:
- **Output envelope invariant**: every query returns:
  - `packs[]`
  - `adequacy`
  - `disclosures[]`
  - `verificationPlan`
  - `traceId` (or explicit `unverified_by_trace(replay_unavailable)`)
- **UC scale without bespoke creep**:
  - UC‑001…UC‑310 are satisfiable **without** “one UC = one endpoint/pipeline”.
  - Every UC domain maps mechanically to ≥1 construction template.
  - Template set is **≤ 12** in v1; templates are reusable programs, not one-offs.
- **Tiers and honesty are real**:
  - Tier‑0 is deterministic and provider-free.
  - Tier‑1 uses real providers or **skips as skipped**.
  - Tier‑2 requires providers and fails honestly when unavailable.
- **Scenario evidence exists**:
  - Tier‑2 scenario suites exist for **≥ 30 scenario families** spanning:
    - repo profiles (R0–R4),
    - workloads (W0–W3),
    - outages/storage modes (D0–D3 / S0–S2),
    - edge cases (E1–E8).
  - Every “works” claim links to a runnable hook + audit artifact.
- **No silent degradation**:
  - provider failures never “fall back” to weaker cognition silently;
  - deterministic maps/packs may still run under degraded modes, but semantic claims must fail closed with explicit `unverified_by_trace(...)`.

### Phase order (full build program; stop-the-line sequencing)

0. **Priority‑0 extraction + boundary lock**
   - Goal: Librarian is standalone; Wave0 consumes only public package API; no product logic lives on the wrong side of the boundary.
   - Gates: `docs/librarian/GATES.json` `layer1.*` (especially `layer1.repoExtraction`).

1. **Kernel (unskippable base)**
   - capability negotiation (required/optional + degraded-mode disclosure)
   - provider gate + adapters (CLI auth only; no fake embeddings)
   - evidence ledger (append-only; correlated; stage/tool/provider events)
   - replay anchor (`traceId` and replayable ledger chain semantics)

2. **Knowledge object system (the atlas)**
   - registries: `RepoFacts`, `Maps`, `Claims`, `Packs`, `Episodes/Outcomes`
   - stable IDs, invalidation rules, freshness cursors
   - deterministic ingestion: AST/indexing, manifests/configs, docs, git metadata

3. **Construction compiler + template execution**
   - intent → `ConstructionPlan` (templates + objects + methods + budgets + adequacy requirements)
   - one template registry (single entrypoint)
   - template selection is recorded in evidence ledger

4. **World-class retrieval + synthesis (D0 only)**
   - embeddings-backed retrieval; graph/rerank only if justified by measured outcomes
   - synthesis emits evidence metadata + defeaters
   - strict separation: ranking scores ≠ epistemic claim confidence (`ConfidenceValue` for claims only)

5. **Work objects + verification orchestration**
   - verification plans compile into durable tasks (DoD obligations)
   - tasks and outcomes are replayable/auditable artifacts

6. **Scale modes**
   - W1 batch bootstrap (resumable; per-file timeboxed; no “one file blocks phase”)
   - W2 watch (incremental; freshness always reported)
   - W3 multi-agent concurrency (bounded contention; stable correlation IDs; conflict objects)

7. **External adapters (optional enrichment; never required for truth)**
   - CI/issues/observability adapters enrich evidence
   - missing adapters produce explicit `unverified_by_trace(external_evidence_unavailable:<adapter>)`

8. **Calibration + learning loop**
   - outcomes captured as first-class evidence
   - calibration artifacts produced
   - claim confidence remains `absent('uncalibrated')` until measured

### Council of 30 roles — enforceable mandates (what must be true in the spec system)

Each mandate is tied to a canonical spec home and an enforcement mechanism. If enforcement is “planned”, the spec MUST label the capability `design` until the hook exists.

### 30 historical lenses — how the council forces “world‑best” without theater

These lenses are not “extra philosophy”; they are directives for what the spec system must explicitly state and how we must prove it.

**Lens 01 — Turing (decidability boundaries)**
- Encode: question classes (decidable vs empirical vs probabilistic vs unverifiable) and refusal correctness.
- Spec translation: “semantic claim” is a distinct category requiring providers + evidence + defeaters; deterministic maps are allowed under D2/D3.
- Proof: negative-control suites where the correct behavior is refusal or “map + verification plan”, not narrative.

**Lens 02 — Shannon (context as channel)**
- Encode: pack codecs and token budgets as first-class contracts; “what got dropped” is mandatory output data.
- Spec translation: “pack rendering” is a deterministic transform with a budget allocator; structure-first (maps) before prose.
- Proof: deterministic pack digest tests + Tier‑2 “TTFU and adequacy under budget” audits.

**Lens 03 — von Neumann (one machine / one IR)**
- Encode: one ConstructionPlan IR and one runtime; forbid parallel “special pipelines”.
- Spec translation: templates compile to IR; IR is the only executable path.
- Proof: drift guards that fail if new entrypoints appear; replay topology checks.

**Lens 04 — Knuth (algorithmic clarity + measurement)**
- Encode: complexity expectations and performance budgets; no “fast” claims without a measurement hook.
- Spec translation: indexing, invalidation, and map construction have explicit algorithm contracts.
- Proof: Tier‑2 performance reports gated by budgets; regression artifacts are required.

**Lens 05 — Dijkstra (simplicity + explicit failure)**
- Encode: no silent fallbacks; refusal and disclosure behavior is a correctness requirement.
- Spec translation: every spec must define D*/S*/E* behavior; “best effort” is forbidden unless labeled partial with missing stages listed.
- Proof: must-refuse suites and “no silent stage skipping” tests.

**Lens 06 — Hoare (contracts)**
- Encode: preconditions/postconditions/invariants for stages and templates; violations produce typed stop reasons.
- Spec translation: every template has explicit required outputs (adequacy, disclosures, verification plan).
- Proof: contract tests and violation traces that show the correct stop reason and disclosure.

**Lens 07 — Lamport (temporal correctness)**
- Encode: ordering/atomicity invariants for ledger + storage under concurrency; multi-agent correctness is specified, not assumed.
- Spec translation: replay semantics and conflict objects are first-class outputs.
- Proof: deterministic concurrent fixtures + replay-digest invariants.

**Lens 08 — Liskov (substitutability)**
- Encode: provider/storage/pack interfaces that can be swapped without changing semantics.
- Spec translation: adapters are behind stable interfaces; “capabilities” not “provider names” flow through the pipeline.
- Proof: shared contract test suite across adapters/backends.

**Lens 09 — Parnas (information hiding)**
- Encode: layers aligned to reasons-to-change; forbid dependency inversions that create drift.
- Spec translation: stable core objects/IR vs volatile ingestion/retrieval adapters vs volatile pack UX.
- Proof: dependency gates and “single registry” tests per surface.

**Lens 10 — Brooks (conceptual integrity)**
- Encode: one user story and one envelope; no micro-API stitching for normal work.
- Spec translation: façade contract defines the agent interaction; templates are internal programs.
- Proof: Tier‑2 scenario suites are written against the façade only.

**Lens 11 — Hamilton (hazard-driven safety)**
- Encode: hazards (hallucination, stale evidence, partial corpora, poisoning, concurrency corruption) and mandatory mitigations.
- Spec translation: safety checks gate synthesis; refusal behavior is required under hazards.
- Proof: must-fail suites that prove refusal and correct disclosures under hazards.

**Lens 12 — Hopper (debuggability as product)**
- Encode: diagnostics and trace inspection are mandatory; “why was this answer limited?” must always be answerable.
- Spec translation: stage report + capability report + adequacy report are always present.
- Proof: “operator can root-cause from artifacts” scenario family.

**Lens 13 — Thompson (boundary discipline)**
- Encode: all real behavior goes through public entrypoints; tests must not bypass surfaces.
- Spec translation: tool registry is single-source and callable via the real schema path.
- Proof: entrypoint traversal tests; drift guards for tool listing vs callTool.

**Lens 14 — Ritchie (portability across repos)**
- Encode: repo profile variability; unknown languages must degrade honestly, not fail silently.
- Spec translation: corpus inventory and partial coverage disclosures are mandatory.
- Proof: fixture zoo across R0–R4 with adequacy correctness checks.

**Lens 15 — Kernighan (clarity)**
- Encode: specs must be readable and enforceable; no competing definitions.
- Spec translation: glossary is canonical; spec format is standardized; summary elsewhere must be non-canonical.
- Proof: doc drift and anti-duplication guardrails.

**Lens 16 — Backus (pure compilation)**
- Encode: intent→plan compilation is deterministic and testable; execution is effectful and logged.
- Spec translation: compilation emits plan digest; execution emits stage evidence.
- Proof: golden compilation tests and replayable plan execution traces.

**Lens 17 — Wirth (disciplined data structures)**
- Encode: stable schemas and versioning; migrations are first-class work.
- Spec translation: facts/maps/claims/packs are structured objects, not blobs.
- Proof: migration tests; schema compatibility gates.

**Lens 18 — Milner (types prevent category errors)**
- Encode: claim confidence is `ConfidenceValue`; ranking signals are separate and labeled.
- Spec translation: builders enforce evidence refs/defeaters; illegal states are unrepresentable.
- Proof: Tier‑0 scans and type-level enforcement preventing raw numeric claim confidence.

**Lens 19 — McCarthy (belief revision)**
- Encode: defeaters and contradiction handling; system must retract/condition claims as evidence changes.
- Spec translation: claim revision events are recorded; conflicts are surfaced, not averaged away.
- Proof: E5 conflict scenario families that require explicit contradiction objects.

**Lens 20 — Newell (methods and meta-cognition)**
- Encode: templates are reusable programs that return “how to proceed”, not just retrieved text.
- Spec translation: verification plan + uncertainty reduction are mandatory outputs for uncertain states.
- Proof: “agent unblocking” suites measuring time/steps to verified completion.

**Lens 21 — Codd (relational integrity)**
- Encode: queryable, integrity-checked knowledge store.
- Spec translation: object store constraints (IDs, references) and corruption behavior are specified.
- Proof: integrity tests; “no orphan refs” invariants.

**Lens 22 — Gray (transactions and recovery)**
- Encode: atomicity/idempotency/resumability; interruption does not corrupt knowledge.
- Spec translation: checkpointing and bounded retries are defined under S1/S2/E8.
- Proof: kill-and-resume suites and multiprocess atomicity tests.

**Lens 23 — Stonebraker (workload-driven engines)**
- Encode: choose engines by workload (relational/graph/vector), unified via planning.
- Spec translation: plan compiler selects cheapest adequate path; vector retrieval is enrichment, not a crutch.
- Proof: evaluation harness that shows engine choice improves outcomes.

**Lens 24 — Hennessy (pipeline and backpressure)**
- Encode: staged execution with timeboxes and partial-result semantics.
- Spec translation: stage reporting is mandatory; timeboxing cannot become silent downgrade.
- Proof: performance artifacts + “no silent stage skipping” suites.

**Lens 25 — Patterson (quantify and iterate)**
- Encode: “world-class” is measured; every feature claims a measurable improvement.
- Spec translation: scenario suites and artifacts are the only accepted proof.
- Proof: regression gates on scenario outcomes and adequacy correctness.

**Lens 26 — Hamming (falsification)**
- Encode: negative controls: must-refuse, must-disclose gaps, must-surface conflicts.
- Spec translation: critics block narrative answers when proof is absent.
- Proof: required negative-control scenario families; refusal correctness gates.

**Lens 27 — Kay (maps as UI)**
- Encode: maps and views are primary UI; synthesis is annotation, not replacement.
- Spec translation: repo map and edit context packs are first-class outputs with budgets.
- Proof: orientation/edit workflows verified by Tier‑2 scenario families.

**Lens 28 — Engelbart (durable augmentation)**
- Encode: outputs compile into durable work objects and artifacts; knowledge compounds over time.
- Spec translation: verification plans become DoD tasks; plan mutations are event-sourced.
- Proof: end-to-end “knowledge → work → artifact → replay” suites.

**Lens 29 — Torvalds (integration reality)**
- Encode: extraction-first boundary discipline; public API stability is a stop-the-line constraint.
- Spec translation: gates block feature work when boundary is incomplete.
- Proof: extraction gates and package-only verification suites.

**Lens 30 — Carmack (instrumentation and determinism under load)**
- Encode: profiling, tracing, and deterministic behavior where possible; debuggability under load is a feature.
- Spec translation: every Tier‑2 run must emit trace + performance artifacts; hotspots are optimized based on evidence.
- Proof: perf regression gates + trace replay reports required for pass claims.

### Tier‑2 scenario families (≥ 30) — required for “full build” claims

These are scenario FAMILY definitions (not one-off tests). Each family must:
- declare targeted profiles (R*/W*/D*/S*/E*)
- declare primary templates involved (`T#` identifiers)
- emit audit artifacts (at minimum):
  - `AdequacyReport.v1.json`
  - `TraceReplayReport.v1.json`
  - `PerformanceReport.v1.json` (where the family is performance-sensitive)
- include negative controls (must-refuse / must-disclose) when applicable

**Scenario Families (SF‑01…SF‑30)**

SF‑01 Orientation baseline (R0/R1; W0; D3) — deterministic maps/packs only; semantic stages blocked with disclosure.  
SF‑02 RepoMap at scale (R3; W0/W1; S1) — token-budgeted map; incremental indexing; explicit partial-corpus adequacy.  
SF‑03 Multi-repo correlation (R4; W0; D2/D3) — cross-repo edges labeled stale/unknown; defeaters required.  
SF‑04 EditContext minimality (R2; W0; D0/D2) — smallest sufficient neighborhood; budgeted; explicit exclusions.  
SF‑05 Change delta and risk (R2/R3; W0; D2) — delta map with git optional; missing git disclosed.  
SF‑06 VerificationPlan compilation (R1–R4; W0; D0/D3) — always emits verification plan; provider-required checks labeled Tier‑2 only.  
SF‑07 Impacted tests selection (R2/R3; W0/W1; D2) — uncertainty disclosure when mappings incomplete.  
SF‑08 Repro+bisect workflow (R2; W1; D3) — produces plan/work objects; never pretends it executed.  
SF‑09 Dependency/SBOM provenance (R1–R3; W1; D2) — manifest-only fallback disclosed when scanners absent.  
SF‑10 Infra map extraction (R2/R3; W1; D2/D3) — IaC/k8s detection; missing adapters disclosed.  
SF‑11 Observability/runbook synthesis (R2; W0; D0/D3) — missing runbooks yields “create runbook” work objects.  
SF‑12 Compliance evidence packs (R2; W1; D2/D3) — missing evidence is explicit; no compliance inference.  
SF‑13 Security threat model + findings (R2; W1; D0) — outputs evidence-backed risks + verification tasks.  
SF‑14 Performance investigation (R2; W0/W1; D0/D3) — refuses to claim perf root cause without evidence; suggests measurement plan.  
SF‑15 API surface inventory (R1/R2; W0; D2) — maps exports/endpoints; no semantic claims required.  
SF‑16 Config precedence tracing (R2; W0; D2) — traces config sources; partial corpora disclosed.  
SF‑17 Authn/authz understanding (R2; W0; D0/D2) — if LLM absent, returns map + verification plan only.  
SF‑18 Data model and schema mapping (R2; W0/W1; D2) — maps schema locations; gaps disclosed.  
SF‑19 Ownership and codeowners (R1–R4; W0; D2) — ownership map; missing ownership disclosed.  
SF‑20 Incident timeline reconstruction (R2; W1; D2/D3) — if logs/issues unavailable, produces explicit external evidence gap + plan.  
SF‑21 Refactor planning (R2/R3; W0; D2) — produces safe step plan + tests selection + risk/impact disclosures.  
SF‑22 Release readiness (R2/R3; W0/W1; D2/D3) — verification obligations; refuses to certify without evidence.  
SF‑23 Build/test command discovery (R1–R3; W0; D3) — deterministic extraction; semantics optional.  
SF‑24 Watch freshness drift (R1/R3; W2; S1) — freshness always reported; degraded watch health disclosed.  
SF‑25 Multi-agent conflict merge (R2; W3; S1) — conflict objects surfaced; no silent overwrite.  
SF‑26 Stale evidence decay (R1–R4; W0; E6) — stale evidence becomes defeater; adequacy reflects staleness.  
SF‑27 Conflicting evidence handling (R1–R4; W0; E5) — explicit contradiction objects; no “averaging away.”  
SF‑28 Oversized input handling (R3; W0/W1; E2) — timebox/truncate with explicit disclosure; no silent drops.  
SF‑29 Provider outage semantics (R1–R4; W0; D3/E7) — semantic stages fail closed; deterministic maps still serve.  
SF‑30 Storage contention/corruption semantics (R2; W0/W1/W3; S1/S2/E8) — bounded retries/backoff or fail closed with remediation.

**Note**: These family definitions are binding requirements; implementation details (exact tests, fixtures, artifact paths) are owned by the Tier‑2 suite specs and gates.

## Spec budget + anti-duplication rule (stop accretion)

This spec system must not become “endless docs” that drift and can’t be implemented. Treat **coherence** as a first-class requirement.

Rules:
- **One canonical home per concept.** If two docs define the same thing, that’s a spec bug. Pick one canonical file; other docs must link.
- **Inventories live in one place.** Examples:
  - Use cases live in `docs/librarian/USE_CASE_MATRIX.md` (do not copy large UC lists into other specs).
  - Construction template contract + template set live in `docs/librarian/specs/core/construction-templates.md`.
- **Prefer extending over adding.** Adding a new spec file is only justified when it *reduces* ambiguity and prevents drift (e.g., by creating a single canonical home).
- **Template admission is strict.** New construction templates are allowed only if they are broadly reusable (≥3 UCs) or they replace/merge existing templates. Otherwise, add a new map/pack type under an existing template. Canonical policy: `docs/librarian/specs/core/construction-templates.md`.
- **If you must summarize elsewhere, label it as non-canonical.** Provide a pointer to the canonical source and avoid duplicating tables/mappings.

## Test tiers (TDD sequencing)

- **Tier‑0 (`*.test.ts`)**: deterministic logic only; no provider calls.
- **Tier‑1 (`*.integration.test.ts`)**: may call real providers; must *skip as skipped* if unavailable (no early-return “pass”).
- **Tier‑2 (`*.system.test.ts`)**: provider-required; must fail honestly if providers unavailable.

This tiering is enforced mechanically (see `docs/librarian/specs/core/testing-architecture.md`).

## How to implement a spec (step-by-step)

1. Pick a spec file and read its entry in `docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md`.
2. Identify the target **operational profiles** (R*/W*/D*/S*) and edge cases (E1–E8) it must cover.
3. Write Tier‑0 tests for:
   - deterministic contracts (types, parsing, schemas, failure modes)
   - “fail-closed” disclosure paths (`unverified_by_trace(...)`)
   - drift prevention (single entrypoint / single registry) where relevant
4. Add Tier‑1/Tier‑2 tests only when the behavior requires real providers.
5. Update gates (if required) in `docs/librarian/GATES.json`:
   - commands must be runnable
   - statuses must not claim `pass`/`partial`/`skip_when_unavailable` without run metadata
6. Update documentation status honestly:
   - “implemented” means runnable + gated; otherwise use `design` or `research_only`.

---

## Changing/adding spec files (mechanical requirements)

When you add or rename a spec file under `docs/librarian/specs/**`:
- Start from `docs/librarian/specs/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md` (recommended).
- Add/update its entry in `docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md` (required).
- Use `docs/librarian/specs/core/operational-profiles.md` vocabulary for conditions.
- If its `Status:` is `executable`, include at least one runnable verification hook.

Tier‑0 enforcement:
- `src/librarian/__tests__/librarian_spec_behavior_index.test.ts`

---

## Validation commands

Deterministic gate:
- `npm run test:tier0`

Librarian-only deterministic tests:
- `npm --prefix packages/librarian test -- --run`

Live-provider gates (Tier‑2) are intentionally separate; see:
- `docs/librarian/GATES.json`

---

## Spec system map (where instructions live)

- `docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md`
  - The behavioral contract index. Every spec file must have an entry here.
- `docs/librarian/specs/core/operational-profiles.md`
  - Shared vocabulary for repo profiles (R*), workloads (W*), dependencies/storage (D*/S*), edge cases (E1–E8).
- `docs/librarian/specs/core/testing-architecture.md`
  - Tier policy + “no theater” rules.
- `docs/librarian/specs/INTEGRATION_CHANGE_LIST.md`
  - Concrete integration work required for executability (wiring, drift fixes, sequencing).
- `docs/librarian/specs/IMPLEMENTATION_FAILURE_RCA.md`
  - Root-causes and mechanical guardrails (tests/gates) that prevent repeat failure.
- `docs/librarian/specs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
  - “Verified vs unverified” truth table; do not mark “done” without evidence.
- `docs/librarian/specs/GLOSSARY.md`
  - Canonical terminology; avoid competing definitions.
- `docs/librarian/specs/EXTRACTION_INDEX.md` + `docs/librarian/specs/EXTRACTION_GAP_REPORT.md`
  - Accounting for theory→spec extraction gaps (prevents “complete” theater).

## Definition of done (per spec status)

### If a spec entry is `executable`

It must be implementable without guesswork and must not lie:
- Behavioral contract covers relevant profiles (R*/W*/D*/S*) and edge cases (E1–E8) via the spec itself and/or its `BEHAVIOR_INDEX` entry.
- At least one runnable verification hook exists and is referenced in `BEHAVIOR_INDEX` (`Verification:` field).
- Tests obey tier rules:
  - Tier‑0 is deterministic only (no providers).
  - Tier‑1 uses real providers and skips honestly when unavailable.
  - Tier‑2 requires providers and fails honestly when unavailable.
- Degradation is explicit:
  - required capability missing ⇒ `unverified_by_trace(...)` (fail closed)
  - optional capability missing ⇒ degraded mode + disclosure (no silent changes)

### If a spec entry is `design`

- It can be incomplete, but it must say what is missing and what the system must do until it is implemented:
  - missing core dependency ⇒ `unverified_by_trace(extraction_missing|replay_unavailable|capability_missing|...)`
- It must not use “Implemented” labels unless there is runnable evidence.

### If a spec entry is `research_only`

- It must be treated as reference material only, never as an implemented capability.

---

## Writing behavior (required content)

When you write or update a spec, ensure behavior is observable under the operational profiles:

- **Repo profile (R0–R4)**: what changes for docs-only vs monorepo vs multi-repo?
- **Workload (W0–W3)**: interactive latency vs batch throughput vs watch stability vs multi-agent concurrency.
- **Dependencies (D0–D3) and storage (S0–S2)**: what fails closed vs what can degrade?
- **Edge cases (E1–E8)**: what happens for empty inputs, oversized inputs, partial corpora, stale/conflicting evidence, outages, storage contention?

Rule: if the spec describes an “answer” or “claim”, it must describe the disclosure behavior:
- what is claimed
- what is not claimed
- what is marked as unknown / unverified

---

## Evidence hooks (how to make specs executable)

Use the smallest honest hook that would catch regressions:

- **Tier‑0**: schemas, type boundaries, deterministic transforms, fail-closed errors, “single entrypoint” drift guards.
- **Tier‑1**: integration with real providers, but skip with `ctx.skip(...)` when unavailable (must show as skipped).
- **Tier‑2**: end-to-end behavior. No mocks. If providers are missing, fail with `unverified_by_trace(provider_unavailable)`.

If you add or change a gate in `docs/librarian/GATES.json`:
- the command must be runnable
- statuses `pass|partial|skip_when_unavailable` must include `lastRun` and `evidence`
- do not add “string count” gates (they’re theater)

---

## Standard `unverified_by_trace(...)` guidance

Use stable, specific reasons so failures are actionable and searchable. Common reasons:
- `provider_unavailable` (no required providers)
- `embedding_unavailable` (embeddings required but missing)
- `llm_required` (LLM required but missing)
- `capability_missing(<capability>)` (capability negotiation blocks operation)
- `replay_unavailable` (evidence/replay chain missing for a claim)
- `extraction_missing` (spec extraction prerequisite not done)

Rule: do not invent “confidence numbers” to paper over missing evidence; use `ConfidenceValue` semantics and disclose absence.

---

## Anti-repeat mechanics (do this, every time)

- One registry / one entrypoint / one deterministic drift test for every public surface (provider gate, MCP tools, query pipeline).
- Never mark “implemented” without runnable evidence.
- Never “skip” by returning early in tests (that’s a pass, and it’s theater).

---

## Worked example (recommended): Evidence-ledger wiring slice

This is the canonical way to turn a “design” spec into verified behavior without guessing.

### Goal

Wire one concrete event source into the unified evidence ledger with stable correlation IDs, using Tier‑0-first TDD.

Recommended spec targets:
- `docs/librarian/specs/core/evidence-ledger.md`
- `docs/librarian/specs/layer2-infrastructure.md`

### Step 0: Define the observable behavior (before coding)

Pick one event source (examples):
- Provider gate “check/require” events
- MCP tool calls
- Query pipeline stage start/end events
- Technique execution operator events

Write behavior statements in one place (either in the spec file or its `BEHAVIOR_INDEX` entry) using the profile vocabulary:
- Under D3 (providers unavailable): the system must still log the outage event and surface `unverified_by_trace(provider_unavailable)` in outputs.
- Under S1 (storage locked/busy): ledger append must retry in a bounded way or fail closed with explicit disclosure (no silent drops).
- Under W3 (multi-agent): events must carry a stable `sessionId`/correlation ID so interleaving is not ambiguous.

### Step 1: Add a Tier‑0 test for the behavior (deterministic)

Create a new Tier‑0 test that:
- constructs the subsystem with a stub/in-memory `IEvidenceLedger`
- triggers the event source deterministically
- asserts that:
  - an entry is appended
  - `kind` is correct (e.g., `tool_call`)
  - `sessionId` (or correlation ID) is present and stable
  - the payload includes enough metadata to debug (duration/result digest/params digest where relevant)

Constraints:
- No provider calls in Tier‑0 tests.
- No stubbing “semantic success” (adapter stubs allowed only for wiring/format assertions).

### Step 2: Implement the smallest wiring seam (single entrypoint)

Implementation rules:
- Add wiring at the actual public entrypoint (not a helper called only by tests).
- Ensure there is only one path to emit the event (avoid “dual logging” drift).
- If you introduce a new correlation ID shape, define it once and thread it through callsites rather than generating per-subsystem IDs.

### Step 3: Add tiered behavior for providers (Tier‑1/2)

If the behavior is provider-dependent:
- Tier‑1 test: use real providers when available; otherwise `ctx.skip(...)` with an `unverified_by_trace(provider_unavailable)` explanation.
- Tier‑2 test: `requireProviders(...)` and fail honestly if missing.

### Step 4: Add a gate or audit artifact (when it matters)

If the behavior is a “system invariant” (e.g., “ledger correlation IDs exist across subsystems”):
- Add a gate task in `docs/librarian/GATES.json` pointing to a runnable command.
- Do not mark `pass|partial|skip_when_unavailable` without `lastRun` and a human-readable `evidence` string.

### Step 5: Update spec bookkeeping honestly

- Update `docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md`:
  - If the spec is `executable`, include `Verification:` that points to the test/gate you added.
- Update `docs/librarian/specs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (if this moves something from missing → partial → verified).

### Step 6: Validate deterministically

Run:
- `npm run test:tier0`

If Tier‑0 is green, only then proceed to Tier‑1/Tier‑2 runs (if applicable).

---

## Worked example (recommended): Adding a new spec file

1. Copy `docs/librarian/specs/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md` to the new spec path.
2. Fill in the behavioral contract first (profiles + edge cases + degradation policy).
3. Add the new file to `docs/librarian/specs/BEHAVIOR_INDEX.md` (required), including `Verification:` if `executable`.
4. Add/adjust Tier‑0 tests and gates so the behavior is not “paper only”.
5. Validate: `npm run test:tier0`.
