# API Design Use Case Test Results

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Test Type:** API Design Discovery Assessment
**Codebase:** librarian

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Grade: D (Poor for API Design Use Cases)**

The librarian system performed poorly at helping developers understand its own public API surface. While it successfully found versioning-related functions, it largely failed to identify the actual public API exports, API contracts, or documentation patterns. Most queries returned generic internal functions rather than the documented public interface.

---

## Test Results

### Query 1: "public API surface and exported functions"

**Result: FAIL**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 0.910 |
| Packs Found | 6 |
| Latency | 1713ms |
| Semantic Match | No (fell back to general packs) |

**What was returned:**
- `buildQueryEpisode()` - Internal function for query episodes
- `setCachedQuery()` - Internal caching function
- `createQueryInterface()` - Factory function (correct, but internal)
- `executeDeltaMap()` - Template execution function
- `parseSynthesisResponse()` - Internal parser
- `parseYamlDocument()` - YAML parser utility

**What should have been returned:**
- `/Volumes/BigSSD4/nathanielschmiedehaus/Documents/software/librarian/src/index.ts` - The main public API file with 800+ lines of documented exports
- `initializeLibrarian`, `createLibrarian`, `queryLibrarian` - Primary entry points
- `preOrchestrationHook`, `enrichTaskContext` - Integration hooks
- `bootstrapProject`, `isBootstrapRequired` - Bootstrap API
- Type exports: `LibrarianConfig`, `LibrarianQuery`, `LibrarianResponse`

**Coverage Gap Analysis:**
The query completely missed the main `src/index.ts` file which explicitly documents the "PUBLIC API SURFACE" in comments and contains the primary exported interface. The file has clear `@packageDocumentation` JSDoc marking it as the public API entry point.

### Query 2: "API versioning and backwards compatibility"

**Result: PASS**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 0.849 |
| Packs Found | 10 |
| Latency | 1155ms |
| Semantic Match | Yes |

**What was returned:**
- `isVersionCompatible()` - Checks version compatibility
- `shouldReplaceExistingData()` - Data replacement decisions
- `runUpgrade()` - Upgrade execution
- `detectLibrarianVersion()` - Version detection
- `upgradeRequired()` - Upgrade requirement check
- `getCurrentVersion()` - Get current version
- `getUpgradePath()` - Upgrade path computation
- `wrapVersioned()` - Schema versioning wrapper
- `getMajorVersion()` - Major version extraction

**Assessment:** This query worked well. The results correctly identified the versioning module (`/Volumes/BigSSD4/nathanielschmiedehaus/Documents/software/librarian/src/api/versioning.ts`) and related functions. The semantic matching was effective here.

---

### Query 3: "REST endpoints or HTTP handlers"

**Result: FAIL (False Positive)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 0.910 |
| Packs Found | 6 |
| Latency | 4796ms |
| Semantic Match | No (fell back to general packs) |

**What was returned:**
- Same generic internal functions as Query 1

**Assessment:** The query returned high-confidence results but they were completely irrelevant. This is a **false negative detection** - the system should have recognized that librarian has no REST endpoints or HTTP handlers and returned empty results with appropriate messaging. Instead, it returned unrelated functions with 0.91 confidence.

**What was missed:**
- The system does not have REST endpoints - this is a CLI/library tool
- Should have detected "no semantic matches" and communicated this clearly
- The result shows "No semantic matches above similarity threshold (0.35)" in coverage gaps but still returned high-confidence generic packs

---

### Query 4: "API documentation and OpenAPI specs"

**Result: FAIL**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 0.818 |
| Packs Found | 7 |
| Latency | 1205ms |
| Semantic Match | Partial |

**What was returned:**
- `buildClaimBoundaries()` - Claim boundary strings
- `deriveProviderReliabilityFactor()` - Provider reliability
- `buildOperatorAcceptanceCriteria()` - Acceptance criteria generator
- `createPrototypeVerificationPlans()` - Verification plans
- `checkCodexHealth()` - OpenAI health check
- `getDescriptionForPattern()` - Pattern descriptions
- `runDocTests()` - Documentation tests (relevant)

**Assessment:** Only `runDocTests()` is tangentially relevant. The system correctly detected "Meta-query detected: boosted documentation in ranking" but still returned mostly irrelevant results.

**What should have been returned:**
- The `@packageDocumentation` JSDoc in `src/index.ts`
- The extensive inline API documentation
- The `docs/` directory content
- Type definitions that serve as documentation (`types.ts`)
- There are no OpenAPI specs (should have been a null result)

---

### Query 5: "breaking changes between versions"

**Result: ERROR**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exit Code | 50 (EINVALID_ARGUMENT) |
| Error | Exhaustive mode requires a structural query |

**Assessment:** This query was incorrectly routed to "exhaustive dependency query" mode, causing a complete failure. The system's intent classification incorrectly interpreted "breaking changes between versions" as a structural dependency query.

**Workaround Test:** Rephrasing to "version upgrade paths and migrations" worked correctly:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 0.647 |
| Packs Found | 10 |
| Latency | 1352ms |

Returned relevant functions:
- `getUpgradePath()` - Version history entries
- `createUpgradeStartedEvent()` - Upgrade events
- `upgradeRequired()` - Upgrade checks
- `compareVersions()` - Version comparison
- `runUpgrade()` - Upgrade execution
- `writeSchemaVersion()` - Schema version writing

---

## Honest Assessment

### 1. Did it identify the actual public API?

**NO.** The first and most critical query completely failed to identify the public API surface. The main export file (`src/index.ts`) was never surfaced despite:
- Having "PUBLIC API SURFACE" in comments
- Using `@packageDocumentation` JSDoc
- Being the primary entry point
- Containing 800+ lines of documented exports

### 2. Could you understand API contracts from results?

**PARTIALLY.** For versioning specifically, the results were useful. But for general API understanding:
- No type definitions were returned
- No interface contracts were surfaced
- No input/output specifications were shown
- Function summaries were too brief to understand contracts

### 3. What API surface was missed?

**Nearly everything:**

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Main exports (`src/index.ts`) | MISSED |
| Primary entry points (`initializeLibrarian`, `createLibrarian`) | MISSED |
| Integration hooks (`preOrchestrationHook`, `enrichTaskContext`) | MISSED |
| Query interface (`queryLibrarian`, `LibrarianQuery`, `LibrarianResponse`) | MISSED |
| Bootstrap API | MISSED |
| Event system exports | MISSED |
| Storage interface types | MISSED |
| Type definitions in `types.ts` | MISSED |
| Epistemics module exports | MISSED |
| Engine toolkit | MISSED |

**What was found:**
- Versioning API (via specific query)
- Internal implementation details (incorrectly)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Index File Blindness
The system does not properly index or weight `index.ts` files that serve as module entry points. These files are critical for API discovery but appear to be treated as generic code.

### 2. Export Detection Failure
The system does not track or query `export` statements to identify public API surface. The semantic search focuses on function implementations rather than what is exported.

### 3. False Confidence on Non-Matches
When semantic matching fails (threshold 0.35), the system falls back to "general packs" with artificially high confidence (0.91+), providing misleading results.

### 4. Intent Misclassification
The query "breaking changes between versions" was incorrectly classified as a structural dependency query, causing complete failure.

### 5. No API-Specific Indexing
There appears to be no special handling for:
- `@packageDocumentation` tags
- `export` statements
- `index.ts` barrel files
- Type definition files
- JSDoc `@public`/`@internal` annotations

---

## Recommendations

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Index export statements** - Track what is exported from each module
2. **Weight index.ts files higher** - These are API entry points
3. **Reduce fallback confidence** - When semantic match fails, don't return 0.91 confidence
4. **Fix intent classification** - "breaking changes" is not a structural query

### Important
5. **Parse JSDoc annotations** - `@packageDocumentation`, `@public`, `@internal`
6. **Create API-specific pack types** - `api_surface`, `type_contract`, `integration_hook`
7. **Track re-exports** - Follow `export * from` chains

### Nice to Have
8. **Generate API summaries** - Automatically create API surface documentation
9. **Detect missing API docs** - Flag undocumented public exports

---

## Conclusion

For API Design use cases, librarian is **not yet production-ready**. The system's strength in versioning queries suggests the underlying technology works, but critical gaps in export tracking and API surface detection make it unsuitable for:

- API documentation generation
- Breaking change analysis
- Public interface discovery
- API contract understanding

The high confidence scores on failed queries are particularly concerning, as they may mislead developers into trusting incorrect results.
