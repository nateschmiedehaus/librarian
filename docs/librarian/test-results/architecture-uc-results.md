# Architecture Use Case Test Results

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Test Type:** ARCHITECTURE Use Cases
**Librarian Version:** Current (main branch)

---

## Executive Summary

The Librarian was tested against 5 architecture-focused queries to evaluate its ability to reveal system architecture, design patterns, and architectural decisions. Overall, the results show **moderate success** in finding architecture-related code, but significant gaps in providing high-level architectural understanding.

### Overall Score: 2.5/5 (Partial Success)

## Test Results

### Query 1: "system architecture and design patterns"

**Confidence:** 0.910
**Packs Found:** 6
**Latency:** 1532ms (first run), 1211ms (cached)

**Results Returned:**
| File | Function | Confidence |
|------|----------|------------|
| query_episodes.ts | buildQueryEpisode | 0.918 |
| query.ts | setCachedQuery | 0.912 |
| query_interface.ts | createQueryInterface | 0.911 |
| delta_map_template.ts | executeDeltaMap | 0.908 |
| query_synthesis.ts | parseSynthesisResponse | 0.908 |
| infra_map_template.ts | parseYamlDocument | 0.903 |

**Assessment:**
- **FAILED to reveal system architecture** - Results show implementation details rather than architectural overview
- No high-level architectural documentation or system diagrams were found
- Results are query-subsystem focused, missing overall system structure
- "Fell back to general packs (semantic match unavailable)" indicates poor semantic matching for architecture concepts
- Coverage gap: "No semantic matches above similarity threshold (0.35)"

### Query 2: "dependency injection and inversion of control"

**Confidence:** 0.675
**Packs Found:** 3
**Latency:** 1110ms (cached)

**Results Returned:**
| File | Function | Confidence |
|------|----------|------------|
| self_improvement_report.ts | getArchitectureActionAndHints | 0.752 |
| self_improvement_report.ts | getConsistencyActionAndHints | 0.752 |
| self_improvement_report.ts | getCalibrationActionAndHints | 0.752 |

**Assessment:**
- **FAILED to find DI patterns** - Results are completely unrelated to dependency injection
- No actual DI containers, factories, or IoC patterns were identified
- The codebase may lack formal DI patterns, but the results don't help understand that
- Lower confidence (0.675) correctly indicates uncertainty
- The functions returned are about self-improvement reporting, not DI

### Query 3: "module boundaries and coupling"

**Confidence:** 0.564
**Packs Found:** 8
**Latency:** 1661ms

**Results Returned:**
| File | Function | Confidence |
|------|----------|------------|
| analyze_architecture.ts | detectLargeInterfaces | 0.818 |
| architecture_advisor.ts | detectGodModules | 0.805 |
| architecture_advisor.ts | createGodModuleRecommendation | 0.752 |
| architecture_advisor.ts | detectUnstableAbstractions | 0.825 |
| architecture_advisor.ts | createCycleRecommendation | 0.752 |
| t_patterns.ts | findNearCycles | 0.752 |
| module_graph.ts | buildModuleGraphs | 0.752 |
| module_graph.ts | resolveTargetModule | 0.737 |

**Assessment:**
- **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Found architecture analysis tools that detect coupling issues
- Successfully identified module graph and coupling detection functionality
- These are TOOLS for analyzing coupling, not the actual module boundary documentation
- Good that it found `architecture_advisor.ts` and `module_graph.ts`
- Does not reveal actual module boundaries in the librarian codebase itself

---

### Query 4: "layered architecture and separation of concerns"

**Confidence:** 0.540
**Packs Found:** 4
**Latency:** 1293ms

**Results Returned:**
| File | Function | Confidence |
|------|----------|------------|
| architecture_advisor.ts | inferLayer | 0.833 |
| analyze_architecture.ts | detectLayerViolations | 0.820 |
| architecture_advisor.ts | analyzeArchitecture | 0.801 |
| self_improvement_report.ts | getArchitectureActionAndHints | 0.752 |

**Assessment:**
- **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Found layer inference and violation detection code
- `inferLayer` and `detectLayerViolations` are directly relevant
- However, these are again TOOLS for analyzing layered architecture, not documentation of the actual layers
- The codebase appears to have layered architecture analysis capabilities
- Does not explain what layers exist in the librarian system itself

---

### Query 5: "architectural decisions and ADRs"

**Confidence:** 0.557
**Packs Found:** 5
**Latency:** 1757ms

**Results Returned:**
| File | Function | Confidence |
|------|----------|------------|
| rationale_extractor.ts | extractDecisions | 0.814 |
| architecture_decisions.ts | supersedeADR | 0.794 |
| architecture_decisions.ts | updateADR | 0.785 |
| loop_orchestrator.test.ts | setupOrchestrator | 0.752 |
| content_cache.ts | getOrCompute | 0.845 |

**Assessment:**
- **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Found ADR management code
- `architecture_decisions.ts` contains ADR lifecycle functions (supersede, update)
- `rationale_extractor.ts` can extract decisions from code
- However, no actual ADRs from the project were surfaced
- The `getOrCompute` cache function is noise (unrelated)
- Missing: Actual architectural decisions made in this project

## Summary Assessment

### 1. Did it reveal the architecture?

**NO - Not effectively**

The librarian primarily returned function-level implementation details rather than high-level architectural documentation. While it found some architecture-related code (especially in `architecture_advisor.ts`), it failed to provide:
- System component diagrams or descriptions
- Module dependency maps
- Data flow documentation
- High-level system overview
- Entry points and core abstractions

### 2. Could you understand design decisions?

**PARTIALLY**

The ADR query found ADR management tools, but not the actual decisions themselves. The results suggest the codebase HAS infrastructure for managing architectural decisions (extraction, supersession, updates), but the librarian did not surface the actual decisions made.

### 3. What architectural aspects were missed?

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **System Overview** | MISSED | No high-level architecture documentation |
| **Component Diagram** | MISSED | No visualization or module map |
| **Layer Definitions** | MISSED | Found detection tools, not actual layer definitions |
| **Core Abstractions** | MISSED | Key interfaces like `LibrarianStorage`, `QueryInterface` not prominently surfaced |
| **Dependency Injection** | MISSED | No DI patterns found (may not exist) |
| **Module Boundaries** | PARTIAL | Found analysis tools, not boundary documentation |
| **Data Flow** | MISSED | No data flow documentation |
| **Entry Points** | MISSED | CLI entry points not surfaced |
| **Configuration Architecture** | MISSED | Config layer not explained |
| **Extension Points** | MISSED | How to extend the system not documented |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why the poor results?

1. **Semantic Gap**: The queries used abstract architectural terms that may not appear literally in function-level code
2. **Function-Level Indexing**: The librarian indexes at function granularity, missing file-level and module-level documentation
3. **No Architecture Documentation**: The codebase may lack explicit architecture documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE.md)
4. **Fallback to General Packs**: For Query 1, the system fell back to general packs indicating poor semantic matching
5. **Tools vs Documentation Confusion**: Found tools for analyzing architecture rather than architectural documentation itself

### Confidence Calibration Observation

Lower confidence scores (0.540-0.675) for architecture queries correctly indicate uncertainty, while the high confidence (0.910) for the system architecture query was **miscalibrated** given the irrelevant results.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Index Architecture Documentation**: Prioritize README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and docs/ directory content
2. **Module-Level Context Packs**: Create context packs at module/file level, not just function level
3. **Semantic Expansion**: Expand "architecture" queries to include related terms (structure, design, overview, components)
4. **ADR Extraction**: Actually surface extracted ADRs from the codebase, not just the extraction tools
5. **Improve Fallback Strategy**: When falling back to general packs, prefer documentation files over random functions
6. **Add System Map**: Create automatic high-level system maps from module dependencies
