# Code Pattern Recognition Test Results

**Test Date:** 2026-01-31
**Test Category:** Design Pattern Recognition
**Test Mode:** `--no-synthesis` (raw retrieval without LLM synthesis)

## Executive Summary

The librarian was tested on its ability to recognize five classic design patterns in the codebase. **The results are mixed** - the librarian successfully retrieves code artifacts that implement patterns but does not explicitly recognize or label them as design patterns. The system performs semantic matching on function/code context rather than pattern-level abstraction.

| Pattern Query | Recognition | Relevant Results | Confidence | Assessment |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| Singleton | No | No | 0.910 | Failed - fallback to general packs |
| Factory | Partial | Yes | 0.799 | Good - found factory functions |
| Observer/Event | Yes | Yes | 0.793 | Good - found event emitters |
| Builder | Yes | Yes | 0.826 | Excellent - found builder class |
| Strategy | Partial | Yes | 0.793 | Good - found strategy-related code |

**Overall Assessment: PARTIAL SUCCESS** - The librarian finds code implementing patterns but lacks explicit pattern classification.

## Detailed Results

### 1. Singleton Pattern Implementations

**Query:** `"singleton pattern implementations"`
**Latency:** 2033ms
**Packs Found:** 6
**Confidence:** 0.910

**Result:** FAILED - No pattern recognition

**Explanation from librarian:**
> "Fell back to general packs (semantic match unavailable)."

**What was returned:**
- `buildQueryEpisode()` - Episode object construction
- `setCachedQuery()` - Cache storage function
- `createQueryInterface()` - Query interface factory
- `executeDeltaMap()` - Template execution
- `parseSynthesisResponse()` - LLM response parsing
- `parseYamlDocument()` - YAML parser

**Analysis:**
The librarian failed to find any singleton patterns. The results are generic function contexts with no relationship to singleton implementations. The system explicitly noted "No semantic matches above similarity threshold (0.35)" and fell back to general packs.

**Issue:** The codebase may not contain obvious singleton patterns, or the indexing does not capture pattern-level semantics.

### 2. Factory Functions and Factory Pattern

**Query:** `"factory functions and factory pattern"`
**Latency:** 1546ms
**Packs Found:** 9
**Confidence:** 0.799

**Result:** GOOD - Successfully identified factory functions

**Explanation from librarian:**
> "Added 2 graph-similar entities. Scored candidates using multi-signal relevance model. Added 9 packs from semantic + graph candidates. Ranked 9 candidates (avg score 0.58)."

**Relevant Results Found:**
| Function | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `fromId()` | technique_composition_builder.ts | Static factory creating a builder by ID |
| `createTechniqueContractBridge()` | technique_contract_bridge.ts | Factory function creating TechniqueContractBridge |
| `createHypothesisGenerator()` | hypothesis_generator.ts | Factory function for HypothesisGenerator |
| `createFixGenerator()` | fix_generator.ts | Factory function for FixGenerator |
| `createFixVerifier()` | fix_verifier.ts | Factory function for FixVerifier |
| `createHypothesisTester()` | hypothesis_tester.ts | Factory function for HypothesisTester |
| `createMockTracer()` | composition.test.ts | Mock factory function |

**Analysis:**
Excellent results. The librarian correctly identified multiple factory functions across the codebase:
- Factory methods (`fromId`, `from`)
- Factory functions (`create*` naming convention)
- Test helper factories (`createMockTracer`)

The semantic search successfully matched the "factory" concept to functions that create and return instances.

### 3. Observer Pattern and Event Emitters

**Query:** `"observer pattern and event emitters"`
**Latency:** 1644ms
**Packs Found:** 3
**Confidence:** 0.793

**Result:** GOOD - Successfully identified event system components

**Explanation from librarian:**
> "Added 2 community neighbors. Added 2 graph-similar entities. Scored candidates using multi-signal relevance model. Applied multi-vector scoring to 5 module candidates."

**Relevant Results Found:**
| Function | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `on()` | events.ts | Registers event handler, returns unsubscribe function |
| `emitEvent()` | executor.ts | Emit an event to all subscribers |
| `on()` | executor.ts | Subscribe to executor events |

**Analysis:**
The librarian correctly identified the core observer/event pattern implementation:
- **events.ts:** Core event system with `on()` registration returning unsubscribe functions - classic observer pattern
- **executor.ts:** Event emission and subscription methods

The results show proper understanding of the observer pattern's key components: subscribe (`on`), emit (`emitEvent`), and unsubscribe (return value).

### 4. Builder Pattern Usage

**Query:** `"builder pattern usage"`
**Latency:** 1986ms
**Packs Found:** 9
**Confidence:** 0.826 (Highest confidence)

**Result:** EXCELLENT - Comprehensive builder pattern identification

**Explanation from librarian:**
> "Added 2 graph-similar entities. Scored candidates using multi-signal relevance model. Applied multi-vector scoring to 3 module candidates. Added 9 packs from semantic + graph candidates. Ranked 14 candidates (avg score 0.63)."

**Relevant Results Found:**
| Function | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `fromId()` | technique_composition_builder.ts | Static factory creating a builder by ID |
| `from()` | technique_composition_builder.ts | Static factory from existing composition |
| `buildReferenceSet()` | technique_composition_builder.ts | Builds set of IDs in composition |
| `build()` | technique_composition_builder.ts | **Finalizes composition - classic builder terminal operation** |
| `addPrimitive()` | technique_composition_builder.ts | **Adds element - classic builder fluent method** |
| `setName()` | technique_composition_builder.ts | **Sets property, returns builder for chaining** |
| `parallelBuilder()` | composition.ts | Start building parallel construction |

**Analysis:**
This is the strongest result. The librarian found a complete builder pattern implementation in `TechniqueCompositionBuilder`:
- **Fluent interface:** `setName()` returns `TechniqueCompositionBuilder` for chaining
- **Accumulation methods:** `addPrimitive()` adds elements incrementally
- **Terminal operation:** `build()` finalizes and validates the composition
- **Static factory methods:** `from()`, `fromId()` for builder instantiation

The graph-based retrieval effectively connected related builder methods within the same class.

### 5. Strategy Pattern Implementations

**Query:** `"strategy pattern implementations"`
**Latency:** 4781ms (slowest query)
**Packs Found:** 3
**Confidence:** 0.793

**Result:** GOOD - Found strategy-related abstractions

**Explanation from librarian:**
> "Added 2 graph-similar entities. Scored candidates using multi-signal relevance model. Added 3 packs from semantic + graph candidates. Ranked 4 candidates (avg score 0.55)."

**Relevant Results Found:**
| Function | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `setCalibrationTracker()` | testing_strategy_construction.ts | Set calibration tracker to use |
| `resolveStrategy()` | metacognitive_architecture.ts | Looks up reasoning strategy by ID |
| `setPlannerStrategy()` | hierarchical_orchestrator.ts | Set custom planner strategy |

**Analysis:**
The librarian found strategy-related code:
- **resolveStrategy():** Explicitly uses strategy terminology, looks up strategies from a list
- **setPlannerStrategy():** Allows swapping planner strategies at runtime - core strategy pattern behavior
- **setCalibrationTracker():** Dependency injection of tracker (related pattern)

These demonstrate the strategy pattern's key characteristic: swappable algorithms/behaviors at runtime.

## Pattern Recognition Capabilities Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Semantic matching works for named patterns:** When code uses pattern-related terminology (factory, builder, strategy), the librarian finds relevant results.

2. **Graph-based retrieval connects related code:** The builder pattern query successfully found multiple methods from the same `TechniqueCompositionBuilder` class.

3. **Community/graph analysis helps:** The observer pattern query used "community neighbors" to find related event handling code.

4. **Factory pattern well-indexed:** The codebase follows `create*` naming convention which aids discovery.

### Weaknesses

1. **No explicit pattern classification:** The librarian does not label results as "this is a singleton" or "this implements observer pattern."

2. **Singleton pattern failure:** The query fell back to generic results, suggesting the pattern concept itself isn't indexed.

3. **No pattern-aware indexing:** The system indexes functions/modules but not design patterns as first-class concepts.

4. **Query intent not recognized as pattern search:** The explanation doesn't indicate pattern-specific handling.

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Short-term

1. **Add pattern keywords to embeddings:** Annotate indexed entities with recognized pattern names during analysis.

2. **Pattern detection heuristics:** Identify common patterns:
   - Singleton: private constructor + static instance method
   - Factory: `create*`, `make*`, `build*` prefixes
   - Observer: `on/off`, `subscribe/unsubscribe`, `emit/dispatch`
   - Builder: fluent methods returning `this`, terminal `build()` method

### Medium-term

3. **Pattern-aware query classification:** Detect when queries are asking about design patterns and apply specialized retrieval.

4. **Pattern knowledge packs:** Create dedicated context packs for recognized patterns with:
   - Pattern name and description
   - All implementing code locations
   - Pattern relationships

### Long-term

5. **Static analysis for pattern detection:** Use AST analysis to identify structural patterns regardless of naming.

6. **Pattern catalog integration:** Reference Gang of Four and other pattern catalogs during indexing.
