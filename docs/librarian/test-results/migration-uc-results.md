## Coverage Gaps Identified

The system consistently flagged these gaps:
- **Missing adequacy evidence:** "Document and rehearse rollback plan"; "Ensure observability (logs/metrics/traces) exists"
- **Watch state unavailable:** Indicates runtime monitoring is not active
- **LLM disabled by request:** Using `--no-synthesis` mode

These gaps are informative for migration planning - they suggest considering:
1. Rollback procedures
2. Observability/monitoring during migration

## Migration Planning Assessment

### Strengths for Migration Use Case

1. **Version Management Intelligence**
   - Upgrade requirement detection
   - Version compatibility checking
   - Data replacement decisions

2. **Breaking Change Detection**
   - Dedicated T-14 pattern for breaking change analysis
   - Dependency drift detection
   - Unstable abstraction identification

3. **Migration Infrastructure**
   - Migration script loading
   - Migration execution with audit trails
   - Schema version tracking

4. **Risk Assessment Tools**
   - Outdated dependency detection
   - Architecture tradeoff analysis
   - Legacy project precautions

### What Would Help Migration Planning

| Need | Coverage | Rating |
|------|----------|--------|
| Find migration-related code | Excellent | 5/5 |
| Identify breaking changes | Excellent | 5/5 |
| Version compatibility checks | Excellent | 5/5 |
| Dependency analysis | Good | 4/5 |
| Rollback planning | Limited (flagged as gap) | 2/5 |
| Impact analysis | Good | 4/5 |
| Migration scripts | Excellent | 5/5 |

### Recommendations for Migration Workflows

1. **Pre-Migration Analysis:**
   - Query "breaking changes" to identify T-14 pattern analysis
   - Query "dependency drift" to check for dependency issues
   - Query "version compatibility" to understand upgrade paths

2. **Migration Execution:**
   - Query "migration scripts" to find execution infrastructure
   - Query "schema changes" to understand database migration handling

3. **Post-Migration Validation:**
   - Use adequacy gap hints to ensure rollback plans exist
   - Query "observability" for monitoring during migration

## Verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MIGRATION PLANNING

**Score: 4.5/5**

The librarian system demonstrates strong capabilities for supporting migration planning:

- **High confidence scores** (0.81-0.84) across all queries
- **Relevant results** that directly address migration concerns
- **Rich context** including function signatures, file locations, and line numbers
- **Built-in breaking change analysis** (T-14 pattern)
- **Adequacy gaps** that helpfully remind about rollback and observability needs

**The system would significantly accelerate migration planning** by:
1. Quickly surfacing version compatibility infrastructure
2. Identifying breaking change analysis tools
3. Locating migration execution code
4. Providing tradeoff analysis capabilities for migration decisions
5. Flagging operational concerns (rollback, monitoring) that need attention
