# Observability Use Case Test Results

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Tester:** Claude Opus 4.5

## Test Summary

| Query | Status | Packs Found | Confidence | Key Files Found |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| logging implementation and log levels | OK | 1 | 0.799 | audit.ts |
| metrics and telemetry | OK | 9 | 0.801 | health_dashboard.ts, meta_improvement_loop.ts |
| tracing code | OK | 9 | 0.794 | composition.ts (withTracing), bug_investigation_assistant.ts |
| health check | OK | 10 | 0.803 | daemon.ts, health_dashboard.ts, continuous_improvement.ts |
| debug mode | OK | 1 | 0.398 | debug.ts |

**Note:** Several queries with "and" in the phrase caused timeouts or errors. Simplified queries worked better.

## Assessment

### 1. Did it find observability code?

**Partially Yes.** The librarian found some observability-related code but missed significant infrastructure:

#### Found:
- `src/mcp/audit.ts` - AuditLogger class with structured logging
- `src/agents/self_improvement/health_dashboard.ts` - Health monitoring system
- `src/homeostasis/daemon.ts` - Health check triggers
- `src/cli/commands/debug.ts` - Debug CLI commands
- `src/constructions/composition.ts` - Pipeline tracing (withTracing method)
- Stack trace parsing in `bug_investigation_assistant.ts`

#### Missed (discovered via manual grep):
- **`src/telemetry/logger.ts`** - Core logging module with logInfo, logWarning, logError, logDebug
- **`src/debug/tracer.ts`** - Full distributed tracing implementation (LibrarianTracer class)
- **`src/debug/inspector.ts`** - Debug inspection utilities
- **`src/events.ts`** - LibrarianEventBus with comprehensive event types
- `src/debug/event_bridge.ts` - Event bridging infrastructure

### 2. Could you understand logging strategy?

**Only Partially.** From query results alone, the logging strategy would be unclear:

#### What queries revealed:
- MCP audit logging for tool calls, resource access, authorization
- Health metrics and trend tracking
- Some tracing capabilities in pipelines

#### What queries missed (critical for understanding strategy):
1. **Core Logger (`src/telemetry/logger.ts`):**
   - Uses stderr for all logs to avoid corrupting JSON output streams
   - Simple level-based logging: info, warn, error, debug
   - Context object support for structured logging

2. **Distributed Tracing (`src/debug/tracer.ts`):**
   - Full span-based tracing with parent/child relationships
   - Event recording within spans
   - Trace tree visualization
   - Global tracer instance
   - `traceAsync` and `traceSync` wrapper utilities

3. **Event System (`src/events.ts`):**
   - LibrarianEventBus with typed events
   - 30+ event types covering bootstrap, indexing, queries, feedback
   - Wildcard subscription support

4. **Log Levels/Debug Modes:**
   - `DEBUG` and `VERBOSE` flags used in some files
   - `LOG_LEVEL` referenced in MCP server

### 3. What was missed?

#### Critical Misses:

| Component | Location | Why Important |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Core Logger | `src/telemetry/logger.ts` | Central logging abstraction |
| Tracer | `src/debug/tracer.ts` | Complete distributed tracing |
| Inspector | `src/debug/inspector.ts` | Debug inspection tools |
| Event Bus | `src/events.ts` | System-wide event system |
| Event Bridge | `src/debug/event_bridge.ts` | Event routing |

#### Files with logging/observability (30+ files use console.log/logger):
- `src/api/query.ts`, `src/api/bootstrap.ts`, `src/api/librarian.ts`
- `src/integration/agent_hooks.ts`, `src/integration/feedback_loop.ts`
- `src/homeostasis/daemon.ts`
- `src/storage/sqlite_storage.ts`
- Many construction files and strategic modules

#### The telemetry directory was completely missed:
```
src/telemetry/
  logger.ts        <- NOT FOUND
  __tests__/
    logger.test.ts <- NOT FOUND
```

#### The debug directory was partially missed:
```
src/debug/
  tracer.ts      <- NOT FOUND (most important)
  inspector.ts   <- NOT FOUND
  event_bridge.ts <- NOT FOUND
  index.ts       <- NOT FOUND
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why did librarian miss these files?

1. **Semantic gap:** Query "logging implementation" did not semantically match the module names `logger.ts` or `tracer.ts`

2. **Indexing coverage:** The telemetry and debug directories may have lower embedding similarity scores for observability-related queries

3. **Graph connectivity:** The core logging infrastructure may not be well-connected in the knowledge graph to other "observability" concepts

4. **Query specificity:** The queries used natural language that didn't match code identifiers:
   - "logging implementation" vs `logInfo`, `logWarning`, `emit`
   - "tracing" vs `LibrarianTracer`, `TraceSpan`, `startSpan`

### Confidence Assessment

The confidence scores (0.39-0.80) suggest the librarian was uncertain about results, which is appropriate given the gaps. The low confidence on "debug mode" (0.398) correctly reflects limited relevance.

## Recommendations

### For Librarian Improvement:

1. **Index observability patterns explicitly:**
   - Files in `*/telemetry/`, `*/debug/`, `*/monitoring/` directories
   - Functions named `log*`, `trace*`, `emit*`, `record*`
   - Classes named `*Logger`, `*Tracer`, `*Monitor`

2. **Add semantic bridges:**
   - "logging" should connect to `logger.ts`, `audit.ts`
   - "tracing" should connect to `tracer.ts`, span-related code
   - "observability" should be a meta-concept linking all these

3. **Improve coverage signals:**
   - The librarian correctly reported "unverified_by_trace" but didn't surface the missed files

### For Users:

1. **Try multiple query formulations:**
   - "logger" instead of "logging implementation"
   - "tracer" instead of "tracing"
   - File/class names if known

2. **Check standard directories manually:**
   - `*/telemetry/`, `*/debug/`, `*/monitoring/`, `*/logging/`

   - Tool calls, resource access, authorization
   - File persistence, rotation
   - Statistics and export

3. DISTRIBUTED TRACING
   src/debug/tracer.ts
   - LibrarianTracer class
   - Span-based tracing with parent/child
   - Event recording
   - globalTracer singleton
   - traceAsync/traceSync helpers

4. EVENT SYSTEM
   src/events.ts
   - LibrarianEventBus
   - 30+ typed events
   - Wildcard subscriptions
   - Global event bus

5. HEALTH MONITORING
   src/agents/self_improvement/health_dashboard.ts
   - HealthDashboard class
   - Component health tracking
   - Metrics time series
   - Trend analysis
   - Alerts

6. DEBUG TOOLS
   src/cli/commands/debug.ts
   src/debug/inspector.ts
   - inspect, trace, confidence commands
   - Entity inspection
```

## Verdict

**Grade: C+**

The librarian found some observability code (audit logging, health dashboard, debug CLI) but missed the core infrastructure (logger.ts, tracer.ts, events.ts). A developer relying solely on these query results would have an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of the logging/observability strategy.

The low pack count (1-10 packs) for infrastructure queries suggests the semantic index doesn't adequately cover cross-cutting concerns like observability that span many files but live in dedicated utility modules.
