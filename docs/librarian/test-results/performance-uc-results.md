# Performance Use Case Testing Results

**Test Date:** 2026-01-31
**Tester:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Librarian Version:** Current development branch

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Grade: D+ (Poor)**

The librarian demonstrates significant weaknesses in performance-related use cases. Only 1 out of 5 queries returned genuinely relevant results. The system frequently falls back to generic packs rather than identifying actual performance-critical code. High confidence scores (0.82-0.91) mask fundamentally irrelevant results.

---

## Test 1: "performance bottlenecks and slow code"

### Query Metrics
- **Latency:** 1108ms
- **Confidence:** 0.910 (calibrated)
- **Packs Found:** 6
- **Explanation:** "Fell back to general packs (semantic match unavailable)"

### Results Returned
1. `buildQueryEpisode` - Query episode construction
2. `setCachedQuery` - Cache storage function
3. `createQueryInterface` - Query interface factory
4. `executeDeltaMap` - Git diff execution
5. `parseSynthesisResponse` - LLM response parsing
6. `parseYamlDocument` - YAML parsing

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Identified actual performance-critical code? | **NO** | None of the returned functions are performance bottlenecks |
| Actionable suggestions? | **NO** | No performance-specific guidance provided |
| Relevant to query intent? | **NO** | Complete semantic mismatch |

### What Was Missed

The codebase contains substantial performance-critical code that should have been found:

1. **`src/storage/vector_index.ts`** - Brute-force O(n) cosine similarity search on every query
2. **`src/storage/sqlite_storage.ts`** - Database operations, indexing, query optimization
3. **`src/api/adaptive_pool.ts`** - Worker pool management, resource throttling
4. **`src/utils/query_batcher.ts`** - Concurrency control for preventing resource contention
5. **`src/api/resource_monitor.ts`** - Real-time system resource monitoring
6. **`src/__tests__/performance_regression.test.ts`** - Explicit SLO thresholds (p50 < 500ms, p99 < 2s)
7. **`src/measurement/observability.ts`** - Query latency tracking infrastructure

**Critical Gap:** The vector search performs linear scan on all embeddings - a classic O(n) bottleneck that should be flagged for any performance query.

## Test 2: "caching implementation and cache invalidation"

### Query Metrics
- **Latency:** 1639ms
- **Confidence:** 0.855 (calibrated)
- **Packs Found:** 10
- **Explanation:** "Added 2 community neighbors. Added 2 graph-similar entities. Scored candidates using multi-signal relevance model."

### Results Returned
1. `getQueryCache` - Hierarchical memory cache retrieval
2. `setCachedQuery` - Cache storage function
3. `readPersistentCache` - Persistent cache reading
4. `writePersistentCache` - Persistent cache writing
5. `cacheEmbedding` - Embedding cache with LRU eviction
6. `deserializeCachedResponse` - Cache deserialization
7. `computeDepsHash` - Dependency hash for invalidation
8. `discoverAll` - Provider discovery with caching
9. `getOrCompute` - Compute-if-absent pattern
10. `invalidateByVersion` - Version-based invalidation

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Identified actual performance-critical code? | **YES** | Found real caching infrastructure |
| Actionable suggestions? | **PARTIAL** | Shows what exists but not how to improve |
| Relevant to query intent? | **YES** | Strong semantic match |

### What Was Missed

1. **`src/memory/hierarchical_memory.ts`** - The actual HierarchicalMemory class implementation
2. **LRU eviction policies** - The actual eviction logic and configuration
3. **Cache TTL configuration** - Where cache lifetimes are configured
4. **Cache warming strategies** - Pre-population patterns

**This was the only successful query in the test suite.**

## Test 3: "database query optimization"

### Query Metrics
- **Latency:** 2200ms
- **Confidence:** 0.910 (calibrated)
- **Packs Found:** 6
- **Explanation:** "Fell back to general packs (semantic match unavailable)"

### Results Returned
1. `buildQueryEpisode` - Query episode construction
2. `setCachedQuery` - Cache storage function
3. `createQueryInterface` - Query interface factory
4. `executeDeltaMap` - Git diff execution
5. `parseSynthesisResponse` - LLM response parsing
6. `parseYamlDocument` - YAML parsing

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Identified actual performance-critical code? | **NO** | Same generic fallback results |
| Actionable suggestions? | **NO** | No database optimization guidance |
| Relevant to query intent? | **NO** | Complete failure - "query" matched wrong context |

### What Was Missed

1. **`src/storage/sqlite_storage.ts`** (2000+ lines) - The entire SQLite storage implementation including:
   - Index creation statements
   - Prepared statement usage
   - Transaction batching
   - WAL mode configuration
   - Query parameter validation

2. **`src/storage/__tests__/wal_concurrent_reads.test.ts`** - WAL mode concurrent access testing

3. **SQL Index Definitions** - The storage creates numerous indexes that should be discoverable:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_functions_file_path
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_modules_name
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_context_packs_confidence
   ```

4. **`proper-lockfile` usage** - File-level locking for concurrent database access

**Critical Gap:** The word "query" triggered matches to the librarian's own query system rather than database query optimization.

---

## Test 4: "memory usage and memory leaks"

### Query Metrics
- **Latency:** 1246ms
- **Confidence:** 0.910 (calibrated)
- **Packs Found:** 6
- **Explanation:** "Fell back to general packs (semantic match unavailable)"

### Results Returned
(Identical to Test 1 and Test 3 - same 6 generic fallback functions)

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Identified actual performance-critical code? | **NO** | Generic fallback results |
| Actionable suggestions? | **NO** | No memory-specific guidance |
| Relevant to query intent? | **NO** | Zero semantic overlap |

### What Was Missed

1. **`src/api/adaptive_pool.ts`** - Memory utilization tracking, OOM kill thresholds
   - `targetMemoryUtilization: 0.7`
   - `oomKillThreshold: 0.95`
   - `minReservedMemoryPercent: 0.2`

2. **`src/api/resource_monitor.ts`** - Runtime memory monitoring

3. **`src/storage/content_cache.ts`** - LRU cache with size limits
   - `maxEntries: 10000`
   - `maxSizeBytes: 100MB`
   - LRU eviction on size overflow

4. **`src/utils/query_batcher.ts`** - Queue size limits to prevent memory exhaustion
   - `maxQueueSize: 100`

5. **`src/memory/hierarchical_memory.ts`** - Memory hierarchy management

6. **Potential leak patterns:**
   - Event listener accumulation
   - Closure capture in long-running processes
   - Map/Set unbounded growth

**Critical Gap:** The system has explicit OOM protection (`oomKillThreshold: 0.95`) that should be discoverable for memory queries.

---

## Test 5: "async operations and concurrency"

### Query Metrics
- **Latency:** 1805ms
- **Confidence:** 0.826 (calibrated)
- **Packs Found:** 10
- **Explanation:** "Added 2 community neighbors. Added 2 graph-similar entities. Scored candidates using multi-signal relevance model."

### Results Returned
1. `withSessionLock` - Session-level locking
2. `withStartLock` - Global start lock serialization
3. `execute` (QueryBatcher) - Rate limiting + concurrency control
4. `buildOperatorRuntimes` - Parallel operator execution setup
5. `generateEmbeddings` - Batch concurrent embedding generation
6. `acquire` (Semaphore) - Slot acquisition
7. `executeAllParallel` - Unlimited parallel child execution
8. `executeBatch` - Probe batch execution with concurrency
9. `executeWithConcurrencyLimit` - Limited parallel execution
10. `executeInParallel` - Federated repo parallel queries

### Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Identified actual performance-critical code? | **PARTIAL** | Found concurrency code but missed key patterns |
| Actionable suggestions? | **NO** | No guidance on race conditions or deadlocks |
| Relevant to query intent? | **YES** | Good semantic matching |

### What Was Missed

1. **Race condition patterns** - No identification of potential data races
2. **Deadlock risks** - No analysis of lock ordering
3. **Promise.all vs Promise.allSettled** patterns - Critical for error handling
4. **`src/utils/async.ts`** - General async utilities (exists but not returned)
5. **Worker thread usage** - If any exists
6. **Mutex/semaphore implementations** - Full class definitions

**Partial Success:** Found relevant code but provided no analysis of correctness or potential issues.

## Pattern Analysis: Why Performance Queries Failed

### Root Cause 1: Semantic Embedding Gaps

The embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) appears to have poor representation for:
- "performance" as a software engineering concept
- "bottleneck" as a code quality term
- "memory leak" as a bug pattern

Evidence: 3/5 queries fell back to "general packs (semantic match unavailable)" despite the codebase containing highly relevant code.

### Root Cause 2: Over-Reliance on Term Matching

The word "query" triggered matches to the librarian's internal query system rather than database queries. This suggests lexical matching is overriding semantic understanding.

### Root Cause 3: High Confidence Despite Poor Results

Confidence scores (0.82-0.91) did not correlate with result quality:
- Test 2 (caching): 0.855 confidence - **Good results**
- Test 1 (bottlenecks): 0.910 confidence - **Terrible results**
- Test 4 (memory): 0.910 confidence - **Terrible results**

The calibration system is not functioning correctly for performance-related queries.

### Root Cause 4: No Domain-Specific Performance Analysis

The system lacks:
1. Static analysis for O(n) loops in hot paths
2. Recognition of common anti-patterns (N+1 queries, unbounded collections)
3. Identification of synchronous I/O in async contexts
4. Detection of missing indexes or inefficient queries

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Add Performance-Specific Extractors
Create extractors that identify:
- Loop complexity in hot paths
- Database query patterns (especially in loops)
- Large allocation sites
- Blocking operations in async code

### 2. Improve Embedding for Performance Concepts
Consider fine-tuning or supplementing the embedding model with:
- Performance engineering terminology
- Software optimization patterns
- Common bottleneck signatures

### 3. Add Cross-Reference to Actual Metrics
Link code to:
- Profiling data if available
- Test execution times
- Coverage of performance-critical paths

### 4. Fix Confidence Calibration
The 0.91 confidence on clearly irrelevant results indicates calibration failure. The system should:
- Detect fallback scenarios and lower confidence
- Use result diversity as a signal (identical fallback results = low confidence)

### 5. Index Performance-Related Documentation
The codebase has SLO documentation that defines performance requirements:
- `SLO_THRESHOLDS.queryLatencyP50Ms = 500`
- `SLO_THRESHOLDS.queryLatencyP99Ms = 2000`
- Bootstrap < 5 min for 10k files

These should be discoverable via performance queries.
