# Testing Strategy Use Case Evaluation Results

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Evaluation Type:** Testing Strategy Domain Queries

## Executive Summary

The librarian was tested against five testing strategy use cases. Results show **mixed performance** with some useful findings but significant gaps in understanding testing infrastructure holistically. The librarian identifies function-level test utilities but struggles to surface the broader testing philosophy, tooling setup, and testing gaps.

## Query Results

### 1. Test Coverage and Untested Code

**Query:** `test coverage and untested code`
**Status:** Completed
**Confidence:** 0.806
**Packs Found:** 2

**Results:**
| File | Function | Relevance |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `src/agents/self_improvement/adversarial_test.ts` | `analyzeCoverage()` | 0.799 |
| `src/agents/self_improvement/analyze_consistency.ts` | `analyzeTestConsistency()` | 0.812 |

**Assessment:**
- Found relevant functions for analyzing coverage
- `analyzeTestConsistency()` is particularly useful - identifies mismatches and untested claims
- **Missing:** No information about actual coverage metrics, coverage tooling (e.g., c8, istanbul), or coverage configuration

---

### 2. Unit Tests vs Integration Tests

**Query:** `unit tests vs integration tests`
**Status:** Completed
**Confidence:** 0.827
**Packs Found:** 1

**Results:**
| File | Function | Relevance |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `src/constructions/security_audit_helper.ts` | `computeSeverityBreakdown()` | 0.827 |

**Assessment:**
- **POOR RESULT:** The returned function is unrelated to testing strategy
- Returned a security audit helper function instead of test-related code
- **Missing:** Distinction between unit/integration tests, test organization (`__tests__/` directories), test runner configuration

---

### 3. Test Fixtures and Test Utilities

**Query:** `test fixtures and test utilities`
**Status:** Completed
**Confidence:** 0.800
**Packs Found:** 1

**Results:**
| File | Function | Relevance |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `src/constructions/strategic/testing_strategy_construction.ts` | `createTestingStrategyConstruction()` | 0.800 |

**Assessment:**
- Found a relevant construction for testing strategy
- **Missing:** Actual test fixtures, setup/teardown utilities, test data factories, mock data files

---

### 4. Mocking Patterns and Test Doubles

**Query:** `mocking patterns and test doubles`
**Status:** Completed
**Confidence:** 0.783
**Packs Found:** 8

**Results:**
| File | Function | Relevance |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `src/agents/self_improvement/__tests__/self_index_validation.test.ts` | `createMockQueryInterface()` | 0.854 |
| `src/api/pattern_catalog.ts` | `assertPatternId()` | 0.837 |
| `src/constructions/refactoring_safety_checker.ts` | `analyzeBreakingChanges()` | 0.817 |
| `src/agents/__tests__/loop_orchestrator.test.ts` | `createMockHypothesisTester()` | 0.752 |
| `src/engines/tdd_engine.ts` | `identifyMockRequirements()` | 0.752 |
| `src/engines/tdd_engine.ts` | `matchesPattern()` | 0.752 |
| `src/constructions/__tests__/integration.test.ts` | `createMockLibrarian()` | 0.752 |
| `src/engines/tdd_engine.ts` | `getMockRationale()` | 0.752 |

**Assessment:**
- **BEST RESULT:** Found multiple relevant mock creation patterns
- Identified `createMockLibrarian()`, `createMockQueryInterface()`, `createMockHypothesisTester()` - actual test utilities
- `tdd_engine.ts` has excellent mock rationale and identification logic
- Some noise (e.g., `assertPatternId` is pattern validation, not mocking)

### 5. Critical Paths That Need More Testing

**Query:** `critical paths that need more testing`
**Status:** Failed (multiple attempts, lock contention)

**Alternative Query:** `test infrastructure`
**Status:** Completed
**Confidence:** 0.488 (LOW)
**Packs Found:** 4

**Results:**
| File | Function | Relevance |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `src/constructions/strategic/testing_strategy_construction.ts` | `createTestingStrategyConstruction()` | 0.800 |
| `src/agents/self_improvement/compositions/adversarial_self_test.ts` | `executeGeneratedTests()` | 0.801 |
| `src/agents/benchmark_evolver.ts` | `generatePreventionTests()` | 0.828 |
| `src/knowledge/quality.ts` | `analyzeTestCoverage()` | 0.752 |

**Assessment:**
- Low confidence (0.488) with coherence warning
- Found some test execution infrastructure
- **Missing:** Vitest configuration, test scripts, CI/CD test integration, coverage thresholds

---

## Assessment Questions

### 1. Did it help understand the testing strategy?

**Partially (5/10)**

**What Worked:**
- Found mock creation patterns and utilities
- Identified test consistency analysis tools
- Located the testing strategy construction module

**What Didn't Work:**
- No overview of testing philosophy (TDD vs BDD, testing pyramid)
- No information about test runner configuration (vitest.config.ts)
- Missed the `__tests__/` directory structure and naming conventions
- Query "unit tests vs integration tests" returned completely unrelated results

### 2. Could you identify testing gaps?

**Limited (4/10)**

**Available from Results:**
- `analyzeTestConsistency()` can identify untested claims
- `analyzeTestCoverage()` exists but wasn't surfaced prominently

**Missing Information:**
- No coverage metrics or thresholds
- No list of untested modules or functions
- No analysis of which code paths lack tests
- No comparison of test counts vs code complexity

### 3. What testing infrastructure was missed?

**Significant gaps identified:**

| Category | Missing Information |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Test Configuration** | `vitest.config.ts`, jest configuration, test scripts in `package.json` |
| **Coverage Setup** | Coverage tool configuration, thresholds, report formats |
| **Test Organization** | `__tests__/` directory patterns, test file naming conventions |
| **CI Integration** | GitHub Actions test workflows, pre-commit test hooks |
| **Test Data** | Fixture files, test data factories, seed data |
| **Test Types** | E2E tests, snapshot tests, property-based tests |
| **Test Utilities** | Shared setup/teardown, custom matchers, assertion helpers |

## Technical Issues Encountered

### Lock Contention Problem

Multiple queries failed with:
```
Error [ESTORAGE_LOCKED]: unverified_by_trace:storage_locked:Lock file is already being held
```

**Root Cause:** SQLite database lock contention when running queries close together
**Impact:** 5th query required fallback to simpler query after multiple failures
**Recommendation:** Implement connection pooling or read-only query support

---

## Recommendations

### For Improving Testing Strategy Query Results

1. **Index test configuration files** - vitest.config.ts, jest.config.js, test scripts
2. **Create testing overview knowledge** - Generate module-level summaries of test organization
3. **Surface coverage data** - If available, index coverage reports and metrics
4. **Tag test utility functions** - Identify and specially index test helper functions
5. **Index __tests__ directories** - Better representation of test file locations

### For Improving Query Reliability

1. **Implement read-only query mode** - Avoid write locks for queries
2. **Add connection timeout handling** - Graceful degradation on lock contention
3. **Consider WAL mode** - SQLite WAL for better concurrent reads

## Scoring Summary

| Query | Confidence | Relevance | Usefulness |
|-------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Test coverage and untested code | 0.806 | High | Medium |
| Unit tests vs integration tests | 0.827 | **Low** | **Poor** |
| Test fixtures and test utilities | 0.800 | Medium | Medium |
| Mocking patterns and test doubles | 0.783 | **High** | **High** |
| Critical paths needing tests | 0.488 | Medium | Low |

**Overall Testing Strategy Score: 5/10**

The librarian shows promise for finding specific test utilities (especially mocking patterns) but lacks the holistic understanding needed for comprehensive testing strategy analysis. Key gaps include missing test configuration, coverage tooling, and test organization information.
