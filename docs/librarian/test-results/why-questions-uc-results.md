# WHY Questions Use Case Test Results

**Test Date:** 2026-01-31
**Test Purpose:** Assess whether Librarian explains rationale and design decisions for "WHY" questions
**Mode:** `--no-synthesis` (raw context packs without LLM synthesis)

---

## Executive Summary

| Question | Result | Explained Rationale? |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Why is there a validation_gates.ts file? | Partial | No - returned related functions, not rationale |
| Why does bootstrap have multiple phases? | Partial | No - returned phase-related code, not reasoning |
| Why use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL? | Fail | No - only 1 pack, no design decision context |
| Why is confidence calibration needed? | Partial | No - returned calibration code, not justification |
| Why separate epistemics from storage? | Partial | No - returned storage code, not architectural reasoning |

**Overall Assessment:** **FAIL** - Librarian does not effectively answer "WHY" questions. It retrieves semantically related code but fails to surface rationale, design documents, ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), or explanatory comments that would explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why WHY Questions Fail

1. **Semantic Similarity ≠ Rationale**
   - The system finds code that is semantically similar to the query terms
   - "validation_gates" → finds validation_gates.ts functions
   - But semantic similarity doesn't surface explanatory content

2. **No ADR/Design Document Indexing**
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) would contain rationale
   - The system doesn't appear to prioritize or surface design documentation

3. **No Comment/Docstring Extraction for Rationale**
   - Code comments explaining "why" are not being surfaced
   - Function summaries describe "what" not "why"

4. **Query Intent Not Recognized**
   - System treats "why" questions the same as "what" or "where" questions
   - No special handling to seek explanatory/reasoning content

5. **Missing Rationale Extractor**
   - There is a `rationale_extractor.ts` in the codebase but:
     - Extracted rationales are not being surfaced in WHY queries
     - Or the extractor hasn't captured the design rationale

---

## Recommendations

### Short-term Fixes

1. **Query Intent Classification for WHY**
   - Detect "why" questions and boost rationale-related content
   - Prioritize comments, docstrings, and documentation

2. **Surface Rationale Packs**
   - When answering WHY queries, include packs from:
     - `rationale_extractor.ts` output
     - ADR documents
     - README sections explaining design

3. **Comment-Aware Retrieval**
   - Index and retrieve code comments that explain reasoning
   - Weight JSDoc/TSDoc `@description` and `@reason` tags

### Long-term Improvements

1. **ADR Integration**
   - Create ADR template and index ADR documents
   - Link code entities to their motivating ADRs

2. **Explicit Design Decision Tracking**
   - When code is analyzed, extract "why" explanations
   - Store as first-class context packs

3. **LLM-Assisted Rationale Inference**
   - When rationale is missing, use LLM to infer reasoning from code patterns
   - Mark as "inferred" with lower confidence

## Conclusion

Librarian currently **does not effectively answer WHY questions**. It returns semantically related code but fails to surface the reasoning, rationale, or design decisions behind architectural choices.

For WHY questions to work properly, Librarian needs:
1. Query intent classification to recognize rationale-seeking queries
2. Dedicated indexing of design documentation and ADRs
3. Extraction and surfacing of explanatory comments
4. Different retrieval strategies for different query intents

**Grade: D** - The system finds relevant code but completely misses the user's actual information need (understanding rationale).
