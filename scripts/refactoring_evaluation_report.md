## Detailed Evaluation by Type

### 1. MAGIC NUMBERS (1,258 found) - MIXED QUALITY

**Sample Findings:**
1. Line 369: `pattern.slice(0, 50)` - The "50" is a truncation limit for error messages
2. Line 292-301: `maxConfidence: 0.95` - Already a well-named constant in `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE_MODEL`

**Evaluation:**
- **True Positives:** Some numeric literals that should be constants
- **False Positives:** Many are:
  - String truncation limits (50, 100) - reasonable inline
  - Already in constant declarations (wrongly flagged)
  - Comments describing values (line 292 has `// 0.95 ceiling` flagged as "95")

**Accuracy Estimate: ~30% true positives**

The detector fails to recognize:
1. Numbers in comments
2. Numbers that are part of well-named constant assignments
3. String slice lengths for display truncation

---

### 2. DEAD CODE (572 found) - HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RATE

**Sample Findings:**
1. Line 383: `} catch (error) {` flagged as unreachable after `return`
2. Line 687-721: Code after `return` flagged, but it's actually a new function

**Evaluation:**
The dead code detector has a fundamental flaw: it looks for `return` statements and flags non-brace lines within 5 lines as unreachable. This fails to account for:
- Function boundaries (return in one function, next line is a new function)
- Catch blocks (return in try, catch block is still reachable)
- Switch case fall-through patterns

**Accuracy Estimate: ~5-10% true positives**

This detector produces extremely noisy results and should be considered unreliable.

---

### 3. SIMPLIFY_BOOLEAN / Nested Ternaries (381 found) - HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RATE

**Sample Findings:**
```typescript
// Line 106: Flagged as "nested ternary"
scope: scope ?? []
// Line 1082: Flagged as "nested ternary"
intent: response.query?.intent ?? ''
```

**Evaluation:**
The detector looks for lines with 2+ `?` characters and a `:`. This incorrectly flags:
- Nullish coalescing operators (`??`)
- Optional chaining (`?.`)
- TypeScript type annotations (`?: Type`)

These are NOT nested ternaries but legitimate TypeScript/JavaScript syntax.

**Accuracy Estimate: ~2% true positives**

This detector is fundamentally broken for TypeScript/modern JavaScript codebases.

---

### 4. DUPLICATE CODE (1,272 found) - MIXED QUALITY

**Sample Findings:**
- Consecutive lines in array literals flagged as duplicates
- Comment blocks flagged as duplicates
- Import statement patterns flagged

**Evaluation:**
The simple 5-line block comparison catches:
- Actual duplicated logic (TRUE POSITIVES)
- Similar-looking but unrelated code (FALSE POSITIVES)
- Comment sections with similar formatting
- Array/object literal patterns that are inherently similar

**Accuracy Estimate: ~20-30% true positives**

Needs more sophisticated analysis (AST-based clone detection, semantic similarity).

---

### 5. EXTRACT_FUNCTION / Long Functions (142 found) - LEGITIMATE

**Sample Findings:**
1. `getFileCategory` at 61 lines - Function that categorizes files by path/extension
2. Various `project*View` functions at 42-44 lines

**Evaluation:**
These are genuinely legitimate suggestions. Functions over 40 lines often benefit from extraction. The identified functions could reasonably be refactored:
- `getFileCategory`: Could extract switch-case blocks to helper functions
- View functions: Could extract common patterns

**Accuracy Estimate: ~85-90% true positives**

This is the most reliable detector.

---

### 6. PARAMETER OBJECT (55 found) - LEGITIMATE

**Sample Findings:**
```typescript
// Line 64-68: Event factory functions with 4+ parameters
createBootstrapPhaseCompleteEvent(workspace, phase, durationMs, itemsProcessed)
createBootstrapCompleteEvent(workspace, success, durationMs, error)
createIndexingCompleteEvent(taskId, filesProcessed, functionsIndexed, durationMs)
```

**Evaluation:**
These are legitimate suggestions. Functions with 4+ parameters often benefit from:
- Named parameters via options objects
- Better self-documentation at call sites
- Easier future extension

However, some cases (like event factories) may intentionally use positional parameters for performance or simplicity.

**Accuracy Estimate: ~70-80% true positives**

---

### 7. DECOMPOSE_CONDITIONAL (15 found) - LEGITIMATE

**Sample Findings:**
```typescript
// Line 432: 4 boolean operators
if (['md', 'mdx', 'txt', 'rst', 'adoc'].includes(ext) || fileName.startsWith('readme') || ...)

// Line 447: 3 boolean operators
if (path.includes('docker') || ext === 'tf' || path.includes('kubernetes') || ...)
```

**Evaluation:**
These are legitimate complex conditionals that would benefit from:
- Extracting each condition to a named variable
- Creating predicate functions for reuse

**Accuracy Estimate: ~90% true positives**

---

## Overall Assessment

### Reliability by Detector

| Detector | Accuracy | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| decompose_conditional | 90% | USE AS-IS |
| extract_function | 85-90% | USE AS-IS |
| introduce_parameter_object | 70-80% | USE WITH REVIEW |
| replace_magic_number | 30% | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT |
| consolidate_duplicate | 20-30% | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT |
| remove_dead_code | 5-10% | DISABLE OR REWRITE |
| simplify_boolean | 2% | DISABLE OR REWRITE |

### Critical Bugs Found

1. **simplify_boolean detector**: Incorrectly treats `?.` (optional chaining) and `??` (nullish coalescing) as nested ternaries. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of modern JavaScript syntax.

2. **remove_dead_code detector**: Does not respect function boundaries. A `return` in one function flags the start of the next function as dead code.

3. **replace_magic_number detector**: Fails to exclude numbers that are already in named constant declarations.

### Recommended Improvements

1. **For simplify_boolean**: Use proper tokenization to distinguish `?:` ternaries from `?.` and `??` operators.

2. **For remove_dead_code**: Parse function boundaries (count braces) before looking for unreachable code.

3. **For replace_magic_number**:
   - Exclude numbers in comments
   - Better detection of constant declarations
   - Consider context (string slicing, array indices)

4. **For consolidate_duplicate**:
   - Use AST-based clone detection
   - Skip trivial matches (comments, simple assignments)
   - Require semantic similarity, not just textual

## Conclusion

The `findRefactoringOpportunities` function provides **useful but noisy** results. The long function and complex conditional detectors work well, but the dead code and nested ternary detectors produce unacceptably high false positive rates.

**Recommendation**: Filter results to only show:
- `extract_function`
- `decompose_conditional`
- `introduce_parameter_object`

The other detectors need significant improvement before being production-ready.

**Signal-to-noise ratio**: Approximately 25-30% of suggestions are actionable. The remaining 70-75% are false positives that would waste developer time.
