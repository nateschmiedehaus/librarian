/**
 * @fileoverview Defeater Activation System
 *
 * Implements active defeater checking for knowledge validation.
 * Unlike passive defeaters that just describe potential invalidation,
 * this module actively checks if defeater conditions are met.
 *
 * Based on Pollock's defeaters from argumentation theory:
 * - Rebutting defeaters: Direct evidence against the claim
 * - Undercutting defeaters: Attack the justification, not the claim
 * - Undermining defeaters: Reduce confidence without full defeat
