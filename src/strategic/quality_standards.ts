/**
 * @fileoverview World-Class Quality Standards for Software Development
 *
 * Comprehensive quality dimensions that define what "world-class" means
 * for software artifacts. These standards go beyond typical metrics to
 * include epistemic standards unique to AI-augmented development.
 *
 * Key dimensions:
 * - Correctness: Functional, semantic, and structural correctness
 * - Completeness: Requirements coverage and documentation
 * - Reliability: Error rates, availability, latency, and recovery
 * - Maintainability: Dependencies, freshness, and technical debt
 * - Epistemic: Calibration, grounding, and hallucination prevention
 *
 * Industry Standards Incorporated:
 * - DORA Metrics: DevOps Research and Assessment performance benchmarks
 * - Google SRE: Site Reliability Engineering principles (error budgets, SLOs)
 * - ISO 25010: Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation
 * - CISQ: Consortium for Information & Software Quality standards
 * - SQALE: Software Quality Assessment based on Lifecycle Expectations
 * - Robert Martin's Metrics: Afferent/efferent coupling, instability, abstractness
