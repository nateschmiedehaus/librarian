/**

 *
 * PHILOSOPHICAL ALIGNMENT (UNDERSTANDING_LAYER.md):
 * The understanding layer represents deep semantic knowledge about code -
 * not just what the code is, but what it means, why it exists, and how
 * it relates to the broader system.
 *
 * This module provides:
 * - Knowledge Aggregation: Parent-child knowledge rollup with confidence propagation
 * - Defeater Inheritance: Severity-based propagation of knowledge defeaters
 * - Aggregation Caching: TTL-based caching for aggregated knowledge
